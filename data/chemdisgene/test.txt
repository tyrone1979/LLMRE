10095983|t|New aspects in the management of obesity: operation and the impact of lipase inhibitors.
10095983|a|Obesity is an increasing health problem in most developed countries and its prevalence is also increasing in developing countries. There has been no great success with dietary means and life style modification for permanent weight loss. Various surgical treatment methods for obesity are now available. They are aimed at limiting oral energy intake with or without causing dumping or inducing selective maldigestion and malabsorption. Based on current literature, up to 75% of excess weight is lost by surgical treatment with concomitant disappearance of hyperlipidaemias, type 2 diabetes, hypertension or sleep apnoea. The main indication for operative treatment is morbid obesity (body mass index greater than 40 kg/m2) or severe obesity (body mass index &gt; 35 kg/m2) with comorbidities of obesity. Orlistat is a new inhibitor of pancreatic lipase enzyme. At doses of 120 mg three times per day with meals it results in a 30% reduction in dietary fat absorption, which equals approximately 200 kcal daily energy deficit. In the long term, orlistat has been shown to be more effective than placebo in reducing body weight and serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Orlistat has a lowering effect on serum cholesterol independent of weight loss. Along with weight loss, orlistat also favourably affects blood pressure and glucose and insulin levels in obese individuals and in obese type 2 diabetic patients.

10226872|t|Disodium cromoglycate does not prevent terbutaline-induced desensitization of beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated cardiovascular in vivo functions in human volunteers.
10226872|a|In humans, prolonged administration of the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist terbutaline leads to a desensitization of beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated cardiovascular responses, which can be blunted by concomitant administration of the antianaphylactic drug ketotifen. This study investigated the effect of disodium cromoglycate, another antiallergic drug, on terbutaline-induced desensitization of beta-adrenoceptor-mediated cardiovascular and noncardiovascular responses. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized design, nine healthy male volunteers received disodium cromoglycate (4 x 200 mg/day, p.o.) or placebo for 3 weeks with terbutaline (3 x 5 mg/day, p.o.) administered concomitantly during the last 2 weeks. beta 2-Adrenoceptor cardiovascular function was assessed by the increase in heart rate and reduction of diastolic blood pressure induced by an incremental intravenous infusion of the unselective beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline; beta 1-adrenoceptor cardiovascular function was assessed by exercise-induced tachycardia. Tremulousness was monitored as a beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated noncardiovascular effect. After 2 weeks' administration of terbutaline, there was a marked and significant (p &lt; 0.001) attenuation of isoprenaline-induced tachycardia (mean percentage attenuation, 53.3%) and of the isoprenaline-induced decrease in diastolic blood pressure (mean percentage attenuation, 55.6%). Exercise-induced tachycardia also was significantly (p &lt; 0.001) blunted, but the magnitude of this attenuation was only very small (mean attenuation, 5.6%). Disodium cromoglycate affected neither the rightward shift of beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated responses nor the small rightward shift in beta 1-adrenoceptor-mediated exercise tachycardia after 2 weeks' administration of terbutaline. Tremulousness observed during the first few days of terbutaline administration disappeared after 4 to 8 days, indicating development of desensitization of beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated noncardiovascular responses. This was not prevented by disodium cromoglycate. These results confirm that long-term beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist therapy leads to a desensitization of beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated cardiovascular and noncardiovascular effects in humans in vivo. However, unlike ketotifen, cromolyn sodium is not able to attenuate this desensitization.

10373451|t|Cloning and characterization of a novel human phosphodiesterase that hydrolyzes both cAMP and cGMP (PDE10A).
10373451|a|cDNA encoding a novel phosphodiesterase (PDE) was isolated from a human fetal lung cDNA library and designated PDE10A. The deduced amino acid sequence contains 779 amino acids, including a putative cGMP binding sequence in the amino-terminal portion of the molecule and a catalytic domain that is 16-47% identical in amino acid sequence to those of other PDE families. Recombinant PDE10A transfected and expressed in COS-7 cells hydrolyzed cAMP and cGMP with Km values of 0.26 and 7.2 microM, respectively, and Vmax with cGMP was almost twice that with cAMP. Of the PDE inhibitors tested, dipyridamole was most effective, with IC50 values of 1.2 and 0.45 microM for inhibition of cAMP and cGMP hydrolysis, respectively. cGMP inhibited hydrolysis of cAMP, and cAMP inhibited cGMP hydrolysis with IC50 values of 14 and 0.39 microM, respectively. Thus, PDE10A exhibited properties of a cAMP PDE and a cAMP-inhibited cGMP PDE. PDE10A transcripts were particularly abundant in the putamen and caudate nucleus regions of brain and in thyroid and testis, and in much lower amounts in other tissues. The PDE10A gene was located on chromosome 6q26 by fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis. PDE10A represents a new member of the PDE superfamily, exhibiting unique kinetic properties and inhibitor sensitivity.

10381812|t|Expression of multiple alpha1-adrenoceptors on vascular smooth muscle: correlation with the regulation of contraction.
10381812|a|Previous work has shown that the genes encoding each alpha1-adrenoceptor subtype are coexpressed throughout the peripheral vascular system. We have evaluated subtype-selective antibodies as tools to determine the extent of protein expression in arteries. The alpha1A-, alpha1B-, and alpha1D-adrenoceptors were detected in the medial layer of the aorta, caudal, femoral, iliac, renal, superior mesenteric, and mesenteric resistance arteries. In Rat1 fibroblasts expressing each subtype, immunoreactivity was noted both on the cell surface and in a perinuclear orientation. Intense alpha1B-adrenoceptor immunostaining was similarly localized in cultured femoral and renal vascular smooth muscle cells. Although the cellular localization appeared to be the same, immunoreactivity obtained with alpha1A- and alpha1D-adrenoceptors was much less intense than that with the alpha1B-adrenoceptor. The alpha1A-adrenoceptor selective agonist A-61603 was 22-fold more potent in activating renal artery contraction when compared with the femoral artery. The expression of each alpha1-adrenoceptor was significantly decreased by in vivo application of antisense oligonucleotides targeted against each subtype. Inhibition of the expression of only one, the alpha1A in renal and the alpha1D in femoral arteries, reduced the contractile response to naphazoline. The results show: 1) subtype-selective antibodies can be used in tissues and cell culture to localize the alpha1-adrenoceptor subtypes, 2) in addition to expression on the cell surface, the alpha1-adrenoceptors are expressed intracellularly, and 3) despite expression of all adrenoceptors, a single subtype mediates the contractile response in the femoral and renal arteries.

10485483|t|Increased cyclooxygenase-2 expression in human pancreatic carcinomas and cell lines: growth inhibition by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
10485483|a|Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 mRNA and protein expression were found to be frequently elevated in human pancreatic adenocarcinomas and cell lines derived from such tumors. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated cytoplasmic COX-2 expression in 14 of 21 (67%) pancreatic carcinomas. The level of COX-2 mRNA was found to be elevated in carcinomas, relative to histologically normal pancreas from a healthy individual, as assessed by reverse transcription-PCR. COX-2 protein expression was detected by the Western blot assay in three of five pancreatic carcinoma cell lines (BxPC-3, Capan-1, and MDAPanc-3), whereas COX-1 protein was detected in two of the five cell lines (BxPC-3 and Capan-1). Increased levels of COX-2 mRNA were found in four of five cell lines, and only in PANC-1 cells was the low level of transcript comparable to that in the normal pancreas. The level of COX-2 mRNA was positively correlated with the differentiation status of the tumor of origin for each cell line, COX-2 protein expression was up-regulated by epidermal growth factor when the cells were grown in absence of serum. Finally, two nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, sulindac sulfide and NS398, produced a dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation in all pancreatic cell lines tested. No correlation was found between the level of COX-2 or COX-1 expression and the extent of growth inhibition. Treatment of BxPC-3 cells with sulindac sulfide and NS398 resulted in an induction of COX-2 expression. Our findings indicate that COX-2 up-regulation is a frequent event in pancreatic cancers and suggest that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be useful in the chemoprevention and therapy of pancreatic carcinoma.

10531013|t|Caffeine inhibits the checkpoint kinase ATM.
10531013|a|The basis of many anti-cancer therapies is the use of genotoxic agents that damage DNA and thus kill dividing cells. Agents that cause cells to override the DNA-damage checkpoint are predicted to sensitize cells to killing by genotoxic agents. They have therefore been sought as adjuncts in radiation therapy and chemotherapy. One such compound, caffeine, uncouples cell-cycle progression from the replication and repair of DNA [1] [2]. Caffeine therefore servers as a model compound in establishing the principle that agents that override DNA-damage checkpoints can be used to sensitize cells to the killing effects of genotoxic drugs [3]. But despite more than 20 years of use, the molecular mechanisms by which caffeine affects the cell cycle and checkpoint responses have not been identified. We investigated the effects of caffeine on the G2/M DNA-damage checkpoint in human cells. We report that the radiation-induced activation of the kinase Cds1 [4] (also known as Chk2 [5]) is inhibited by caffeine in vivo and that ATM kinase activity is directly inhibited by caffeine in vitro. Inhibition of ATM provides a molecular explanation of the attenuation of DNA-damage checkpoint responses and for the increased radiosensitivity of caffeine-treated cells [6] [7] [8].

10548525|t|Regulation of gene expression by activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma with rosiglitazone (BRL 49653) in human adipocytes.
10548525|a|To better define the mechanism of action of the thiazolidinediones, we incubated freshly isolated human adipocytes with rosiglitazone and investigated the changes in mRNA expression of genes encoding key proteins of adipose tissue functions. Rosiglitazone (10(-6) M, 4 h) increased p85alphaphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p85alphaPI-3K) and uncoupling protein-2 mRNA levels and decreased leptin expression. The mRNA levels of insulin receptor, IRS-1, Glut 4, lipoprotein lipase, hormone-sensitive lipase, acylation-stimulating protein, fatty acid transport protein-1, angiotensinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and PPARgamma1 and gamma2 were not modified by rosiglitazone treatment. Activation of RXR, the partner of PPARgamma, in the presence of rosiglitazone, increased further p85alphaPI-3K and UCP2 mRNA levels and produced a significant augmentation of Glut 4 expression. Because p85alphaPI-3K is a major component of insulin action, the induction of its expression might explain, at least in part, the insulin-sensitizing effect of the thiazolidinediones.

10561751|a|Recent studies of hereditary renal tubular disorders have facilitated the identification and roles of chloride channels and cotransporters in the regulation of the most abundant anion, Cl-, in the ECF. Thus, mutations that result in a loss of function of the voltage-gated chloride channel, CLC-5, are associated with Dent's disease, which is characterized by low-molecular weight proteinuria, hypercalciuria, nephrolithiasis, and renal failure. Mutations of another voltage-gated chloride channel, CLC-Kb, are associated with a form of Bartter's syndrome, whereas other forms of Bartter's syndrome are caused by mutations in the bumetanide-sensitive sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter (NKCC2) and the potassium channel, ROMK. Finally, mutations of the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCCT) are associated with Gitelman's syndrome. These studies have helped to elucidate some of the renal tubular mechanisms regulating mineral homeostasis and the role of chloride channels.

10653606|t|24R,25-(OH)(2)D(3) mediates its membrane receptor-dependent effects on protein kinase C and alkaline phosphatase via phospholipase A(2) and cyclooxygenase-1 but not cyclooxygenase-2 in growth plate chondrocytes.
10653606|a|Recent studies have shown that 24R,25-(OH)(2)D(3) mediates its effects on growth plate chondrocytes via membrane receptors. This study examined the roles of phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) and cyclooxygenase (Cox) in the mechanism of action of 24R, 25-(OH)(2)D(3) in resting zone chondrocytes in order to determine whether the activity of one or both enzymes provides a regulatory checkpoint in the signaling pathway resulting in increased protein kinase C (PKC) activity. We also determined whether constitutive or inducible Cox is involved. Cultures were incubated with 24R, 25-(OH)(2)D(3) for 90 min to measure PKC or for 24 h to measure physiological responses ([(3)H]-thymidine incorporation, alkaline phosphatase-specific activity, [(35)S]-sulfate incorporation). Based on RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis, resting zone chondrocytes express mRNAs for both Cox-1 and Cox-2. Levels of mRNA for both proteins were unchanged from control levels after a 24-h incubation with 24R,25-(OH)(2)D(3). To examine the role of Cox, the cultures were also treated with resveratrol (a specific inhibitor of Cox-1), NS-398 (a specific inhibitor of Cox-2), or indomethacin (a general Cox inhibitor). Cox-1 inhibition resulted in effects on proliferation, differentiation, and matrix production typical of 24R, 25-(OH)(2)D(3). In contrast, inhibition of Cox-2 had no effect, indicating that 24R,25-(OH)(2)D(3) exerts its effects via Cox-1. Inhibition of Cox-1 also blocked 24R,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-dependent increases in PKC. Activation of PLA(2) with melittin inhibited 24R, 25-(OH)(2)D(3)-dependent stimulation of PKC, and inhibition of PLA(2) with quinacrine stimulated PKC in response to 24R, 25-(OH)(2)D(3). Inclusion of resveratrol reduced the melittin-dependent inhibition of PLA(2) and caused an increase in quinacrine-stimulated PLA(2) activity. Metabolism of arachidonic acid to leukotrienes is not involved in the response to 24R, 25-(OH)(2)D(3) because inhibition of lipoxygenase had no effect. The effect of 24R,25-(OH)(2)D(3) was specific because 24S,25-(OH)(2)D(3), the biologically inactive stereoisomer, failed to elicit a response from the cells. These results support the hypothesis that 24R, 25-(OH)(2)D(3) exerts its effects via more than one signaling pathway and that these pathways are interrelated via the modulation of PLA(2). PKC regulation may occur at multiple stages in the signal transduction cascade.

10662748|t|Sodium channel blockers identify risk for sudden death in patients with ST-segment elevation and right bundle branch block but structurally normal hearts.
10662748|a|BACKGROUND: A mutation in the cardiac sodium channel gene (SCN5A) has been described in patients with the syndrome of right bundle branch block, ST-segment elevation in leads V1 to V3, and sudden death (Brugada syndrome). These electrocardiographic manifestations are transient in many patients with the syndrome. The present study examined arrhythmic risk in patients with overt and concealed forms of the disease and the effectiveness of sodium channel blockers to unmask the syndrome and, thus, identify patients at risk. METHODS AND RESULTS: The effect of intravenous ajmaline (1 mg/kg), procainamide (10 mg/kg), or flecainide (2 mg/kg) on the ECG was studied in 34 patients with the syndrome and transient normalization of the ECG (group A), 11 members of 3 families in whom a SCN5A mutation was associated with the syndrome and 8 members in whom it was not (group B), and 53 control subjects (group C). Ajmaline, procainamide, or flecainide administration resulted in ST-segment elevation and right bundle branch block in all patients in group A and in all 11 patients with the mutation in group B. A similar pattern could not be elicited in the 8 patients in group B who lacked the mutation or in any person in group C. The follow-up period (37+/-33 months) revealed no differences in the incidence of arrhythmia between the 34 patients in whom the phenotypic manifestation of the syndrome was transient and the 24 patients in whom it was persistent (log-rank, 0.639). CONCLUSIONS: The data demonstrated a similar incidence of potentially lethal arrhythmias in patients displaying transient versus persistent ST-segment elevation and right bundle branch block, as well as the effectiveness of sodium channel blockers to unmask the syndrome and, thus, identify patients at risk.

10752671|t|Evaluation of flutamide genotoxicity in rats and in primary human hepatocytes.
10752671|a|Flutamide, an effective competitive inhibitor of the androgen receptor used orally for palliative treatment of prostatic carcinoma and regulation of prostatic hyperplasia was evaluated for its genotoxic effects in the intact rat and in primary cultures of human hepatocytes. Negative responses were obtained in all the in vivo assays as well as in the in vitro assay. In rats given a single oral dose of 500 mg/kg flutamide, fragmentation and repair of liver DNA were absent, and no increase was observed in the frequency of micronucleated hepatocytes. In the liver of rats given flutamide as initiating agent at the dose of 500 mg/kg/week for 6 successive weeks, gamma-glutamyltraspeptidase-positive foci were detected only in 3 of 10 rats. There was no evidence of a promoting effect on the development of aberrant crypt foci in rats given 100 mg/kg flutamide on alternate days for 8 successive weeks. In primary cultures of human hepatocytes from one male and one female donor DNA fragmentation as measured by the Comet assays, and DNA repair synthesis as revealed by quantitative autoradiography, were absent after a 20 hr exposure to flutamide concentrations ranging from 18 to 56 microM. Taken as a whole, our results seem to indicate that flutamide is a non-genotoxic drug.

10768100|t|Troglitazone reduces plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression and secretion in cultured human adipocytes.
10768100|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Increased plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) concentrations are characteristic for subjects with insulin resistance and could contribute to the increased cardiovascular risk in this state. In this study, we investigated the effect of troglitazone, a ligand of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma, on PAI-1 expression and secretion in human adipocytes. METHODS: We used two models: in vitro differentiated subcutaneous and omental adipocytes cultured under serum-free conditions and isolated subcutaneous and omental fat cells kept in suspension culture. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 protein was measured by ELISA, PAI-1 mRNA by a semiquantitative RT-PCR technique. RESULTS: Exposure of in vitro differentiated subcutaneous adipocytes from young normal-weight females to 1 microgram/ml troglitazone for 72 h caused a reduction of both PAI-1 secretion (by 29 +/- 5%; p &lt; 0.01) and PAI-1 mRNA expression (by 26 +/- 3%; p &lt; 0.05). In cultures from severely obese subjects, troglitazone induced a decrease of PAI-1 antigen secretion from newly differentiated omental adipocytes by 49 +/- 8% (p &lt; 0.01) and from subcutaneous adipocytes by 30 +/- 7% (p &lt; 0.05). Exposure of freshly isolated subcutaneous and omental adipocytes in suspension culture to troglitazone induced a similar reduction of PAI-1 concentration in the culture medium (by 35 +/- 11%, p &lt; 0.05, and 33 +/- 8%, p &lt; 0.05 compared with control, respectively). CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: This study provides evidence that troglitazone reduces PAI-1 production in human adipocytes, probably at the transcriptional level. This observation could point to a new beneficial effect of troglitazone, particularly in obese subjects, which could be associated with a reduced cardiovascular risk.

11006272|t|A novel hepatointestinal leukotriene B4 receptor. Cloning and functional characterization.
11006272|a|Leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)) is a product of eicosanoid metabolism and acts as an extremely potent chemotactic mediator for inflammation. LTB(4) exerts positive effects on the immigration and activation of leukocytes. These effects suggest an involvement of LTB(4) in several diseases: inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, arthritis, and asthma. LTB(4) elicits actions through interaction with one or more cell surface receptors that lead to chemotaxis and inflammation. One leukotriene B(4) receptor has been recently identified (LTB(4)-R1). In this report we describe cloning of a cDNA encoding a novel 358-amino acid receptor (LTB(4)-R2) that possesses seven membrane-spanning domains and is homologous (42%) and genetically linked to LTB(4)-R1. Expression of LTB(4)-R2 is broad but highest in liver, intestine, spleen, and kidney. In radioligand binding assays, membranes prepared from COS-7 cells transfected with LTB(4)-R2 cDNA displayed high affinity (K(d) = 0.17 nm) for [(3)H]LTB(4). Radioligand competition assays revealed high affinities of the receptor for LTB(4) and LTB(5), and 20-hydroxy-LTB(4), and intermediate affinities for 15(S)-HETE and 12-oxo-ETE. Three LTB(4) receptor antagonists, 14,15-dehydro-LTB(4), LTB(4)-3-aminopropylamide, and U-75302, had high affinity for LTB(4)-R1 but not for LTB(4)-R2. No apparent affinity binding for the receptors was detected for the CysLT1-selective antagonists montelukast and zafirlukast. LTB(4) functionally mobilized intracellular calcium and inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP production in 293 cells. The discovery of this new receptor should aid in further understanding the roles of LTB(4) in pathologies in these tissues and may provide a tool in identification of specific antagonists/agonists for potential therapeutic treatments.

11118042|t|Sulindac sulfone inhibits K-ras-dependent cyclooxygenase-2 expression in human colon cancer cells.
11118042|a|Both the sulfide and sulfone metabolites of sulindac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, display anticarcinogenic effects in experimental models. Sulindac sulfide inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme activities and has been reported to suppress ras-dependent signaling. However, the mechanisms by which sulindac sulfone suppresses cancer growth are not as defined. We studied the effects of these sulindac metabolites in human colon cancer-derived Caco-2 cells that have been transfected with an activated K-ras oncogene. Stable transfected clones expressed high levels of COX-2 mRNA and protein, compared with parental cells. K-ras-transfected cells formed tumors more quickly when injected into severe combined immunodeficiency disease mice than parental cells, and this tumorigenesis was suppressed by treatment with sulindac. Sulindac sulfone inhibited COX-2 protein expression, which resulted in a decrease in prostaglandin synthase E2 production. Sulindac sulfide had little effect on COX-2 in this model, but did suppress prostaglandin synthase E2 production, presumably by inhibiting COX enzyme activity. These data indicate that the sulfide and sulfone derivatives of sulindac exert COX-dependent effects by distinct mechanisms.

11134654|t|Pharmacological characterization of almotriptan: an indolic 5-HT receptor agonist for the treatment of migraine.
11134654|a|Almotriptan (3-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-5-(pyrrolidin-1-ylsulfonylmethyl )-1H-indo le) has been studied in several models predictive of activity and selectivity at 5-HT receptors. Almotriptan showed low nanomolar affinity for the 5-HT(1B) and 5-HT(1D) receptors in several species, including the human, while affinity for 5-HT receptors other than 5-HT(1B/1D) was clearly less. Affinity for 5-HT(7) and 5-HT(1A) receptors was approximately 40 and 60 times lower than that for 5-HT(1B/1D) receptors, respectively. Almotriptan did not exhibit significant affinity for several non-5-HT receptors studied up to 100 microM. Almotriptan inhibited forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation in HeLa cells transfected with 5-HT(1B) or 5-HT(1D) human receptors. In this model, almotriptan had the same efficacy as serotonin and an affinity in the low nanomolar range. It induced vasoconstriction in several vessels in which it was compared with sumatriptan. In isolated dog saphenous veins, almotriptan elicited concentration-dependent contractions with an EC(50) of 394 nM. In both these systems, almotriptan behaved as a full agonist. Infusion of almotriptan into the porcine meningeal vasculature induced vasoconstriction. In contrast, in the pig renal and rabbit mesenteric arteries, it had a very low maximal efficacy even at 100 microM, with similar results obtained in the rabbit renal artery. The results suggest that almotriptan is a potent and selective 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonist, with selectivity for the cranial vasculature as compared with peripheral vessels.

11179439|t|The catalytic DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor dexrazoxane (ICRF-187) induces differentiation and apoptosis in human leukemia K562 cells.
11179439|a|The bisdioxopiperazines ICRF-187 (dexrazoxane), ICRF-193, and ICRF-154 are catalytic noncleavable complex-forming inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase II that do not produce protein-linked DNA strand breaks. In this study, we showed that bisdioxopiperazines induced erythroid differentiation, inhibited human leukemia K562 cell growth, and caused a slow induction of apoptosis. Dexrazoxane treatment caused DNA endoreduplication resulting in large highly polyploid cells. This result suggested the lack of a DNA topoisomerase II activity-based cell cycle checkpoint. The percentage of K562 cells that became apoptotic was much larger than the percentage of cells that stained for hemoglobin, suggesting that prior differentiation was not required for induction of apoptosis. Use of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI-571 resulted in a reduction in Bcl-xL levels and potentiation of dexrazoxane-induced apoptosis related to an earlier onset and more extensive cleavage of caspase-3. These results indicated that dexrazoxane-induced apoptosis is associated with a caspase-3 activation/cleavage pathway. In addition, these results were consistent with the antiapoptotic signaling function of Bcr-Abl to regulate expression of Bcl-xL. The ability of dexrazoxane to induce differentiation and apoptosis suggests that bisdioxopiperazines may be useful in treating some types of leukemia.

11181577|t|A nonsense mutation in the NDUFS4 gene encoding the 18 kDa (AQDQ) subunit of complex I abolishes assembly and activity of the complex in a patient with Leigh-like syndrome.
11181577|a|Sequence analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear candidate genes of complex I in children with deficiency of this complex and exhibiting Leigh-like syndrome has revealed, in one of them, a novel mutation in the NDUFS4 gene encoding the 18 kDa subunit. Phosphorylation of this subunit by cAMP-dependent protein kinase has previously been found to activate the complex. The present mutation consists of a homozygous G-->A transition at nucleotide position +44 of the coding sequence of the gene, resulting in the change of a tryptophan codon to a stop codon. Such mutation causes premature termination of the protein after only 14 amino acids of the putative mitochondrial targeting peptide. Fibroblast cultures from the patient exhibited severe reduction of the rotenone-sensitive NADH-->UQ oxidoreductase activity of complex I, which was insensitive to cAMP stimulation. Two-dimensional electrophoresis showed the absence of detectable normally assembled complex I in the inner mitochondrial membrane. These findings show that the expression of the NDUFS4 gene is essential for the assembly of a functional complex I.

11430635|t|Indomethacin activates carbonic anhydrase and antagonizes the effect of the specific carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide, by a direct mechanism of action.
11430635|a|OBJECTIVES: In this paper we investigated the effect of indomethacin, acetazolamide and their combination in vitro and in vivo on carbonic anhydrase (CA) isozymes. METHOD: In vitro experiments followed the effect of the two substances at concentrations between 10(-8)-10(-4) M on purified human red cell CA I and II as well as on human gastric mucosa CA IV using dose-response relationships. Kinetic studies were also performed. The effects of single and combined administration of indomethacin and acetazolamide on red cell CA and on gastric acid secretion were studied in vivo. RESULTS: Indomethacin, in vitro and in vivo. induces an increase in erythorcyte CA I and CA II activity. Acetazolamide, a specific inhibitor of CA, reduces the activity of CA I and CA II from red cells. Indomethacin completely antagonizes CA activity, i.e. abolishes the inhibitory effect of acetazolamide on CA. In humans, an increase or decrease in erythrocyte CA II activity is correlated with an increase or decrease in gastric acid secretion. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that indomethacin, a known cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, is also an activator of CA. Our data also prove that indomethacin is not only an activator of CA but also antagonizes the effect of acetazolamide, a specific inhibitor of this enzyme. In view of the role of CA in acid-base balance as well as the fact that an increase or decrease in its activity is accompanied by an increase or decrease in intra- and extracellular pH, our results suggest that: firstly, CA activation induced by indomethacin might cause changes in COX activity; secondly, PGs are synthetized as a consequence of the changes in COX activity, a hypothesis that requires further study.

11730731|t|Beclomethasone, budesonide and fluticasone propionate inhibit human neutrophil apoptosis.
11730731|a|Inhaled glucocorticoids are widely used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease without much evidence of efficiency in this disease where neutrophils may contribute to the pathophysiology. This prompted us to test the effects of several currently used inhaled and systemic glucocorticoids on human neutrophil apoptosis. Beclomethasone, budesonide, dexamethasone, fluticasone propionate, hydrocortisone and prednisolone inhibited apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner as assessed by flow cytometric analysis, annexin-V binding and morphological analysis. The maximal inhibition of apoptosis was 50-60%. The order of potency was fluticasone propionate (EC(50) 0.6+/-0.2 nM) approximately equal to budesonide (EC(50) 0.8+/-0.2 nM)&gt; dexamethasone approximately equal to prednisolone approximately equal to beclomethasone approximately equal to hydrocortisone. The inhibitory effects of glucocorticoids were reversed by mifepristone. Moreover, glucocorticoids slightly enhanced the inhibitory effect of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) on neutrophil apoptosis. The present data suggests that budesonide and fluticasone propionate prolong human neutrophil survival by inhibiting apoptosis at clinically relevant drug concentrations via an effect on glucocorticoid receptor.

12065695|t|Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs induce apoptosis in association with activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma in rheumatoid synovial cells.
12065695|a|Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been reported to induce apoptosis in a variety of cell lines. In this study, we examined the effect of NSAIDs on the growth and apoptosis of synovial cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and analyzed the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) as a possible mechanism of action of NSAIDs. Cell proliferation and viability were assessed from 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation and by 4-[3-(4-iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene disulfonate (WST-1) assay, respectively. The apoptosis of synovial cells was identified by DNA fragmentation assay and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay. Indometacin, diclofenac, oxaprozin, and zaltoprofen reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptotic cell death in synovial cells, whereas ketoprofen and acetaminophen did not. N-[2-(cyclohexyloxyl)-4-nitrophenyl]-methanesulfonamide (NS-398), a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, also inhibited cell proliferation, whereas it did not cause apoptosis. Rheumatoid synovial cells expressed PPARgamma mRNA, and the PPARgamma ligands 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) and troglitazone reduced the proliferation and induced apoptosis in synovial cells. Luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that not only PPARgamma ligands but also NSAIDs, which could induce apoptosis, increased the activation of PPARgamma in synovial cells. Furthermore, the ability of NSAIDs and PPARgamma ligands to stimulate the activation of PPARgamma correlated with their ability to decrease cell viability(r = 0.92, p &lt; 0.01) and ability to induce DNA fragmentation (r = 0.97, p &lt; 0.001) in synovial cells. These results suggest that PPARgamma is an attractive target for induction of apoptosis in rheumatoid synovial cells and that the activation of the PPARgamma pathway is associated with the apoptotic action of NSAIDs.

12070353|t|A molecular mechanism of action of theophylline: Induction of histone deacetylase activity to decrease inflammatory gene expression.
12070353|a|The molecular mechanism for the anti-inflammatory action of theophylline is currently unknown, but low-dose theophylline is an effective add-on therapy to corticosteroids in controlling asthma. Corticosteroids act, at least in part, by recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs) to the site of active inflammatory gene transcription. They thereby inhibit the acetylation of core histones that is necessary for inflammatory gene transcription. We show both in vitro and in vivo that low-dose theophylline enhances HDAC activity in epithelial cells and macrophages. This increased HDAC activity is then available for corticosteroid recruitment and predicts a cooperative interaction between corticosteroids and theophylline. This mechanism occurs at therapeutic concentrations of theophylline and is dissociated from phosphodiesterase inhibition (the mechanism of bronchodilation) or the blockade of adenosine receptors, which are partially responsible for its side effects. Thus we have shown that low-dose theophylline exerts an anti-asthma effect through increasing activation of HDAC which is subsequently recruited by corticosteroids to suppress inflammatory genes.

12093311|t|Renal failure associated with the use of celecoxib and rofecoxib.
12093311|a|OBJECTIVE: Celecoxib and rofecoxib are two relatively new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that selectively inhibit the cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) isoenzyme at therapeutic concentrations. The nephrotoxic potential of selective COX-2 inhibitors has not been clearly established. This study was conducted in order to understand the association between acute renal failure and the two COX-2 inhibitors celecoxib and rofecoxib. METHODS: A search was performed in the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) to identify cases of renal failure submitted to the FDA. A MEDLINE search of the English language literature was also performed to identify published cases of renal failure associated with celecoxib and rofecoxib. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-two and 142 domestic US cases of celecoxib and rofecoxib-associated renal failure, respectively, were identified in the AERS database. The literature search identified 19 cases of acute renal impairment in association with celecoxib and rofecoxib. In addition, drug regulatory authorities in the UK, Canada, and Australia have received about 50 reports of renal failure with celecoxib and rofecoxib. Descriptive statistics of the AERS cases have been summarised in this report. CONCLUSIONS: Data from AERS and published case reports suggest that use of both these drugs is associated with renal effects similar to that of conventional nonselective NSAIDs. Physicians should be aware that serious or life-threatening renal failure has been reported in patients with normal or impaired renal function after short-term therapy with celecoxib and rofecoxib. Patients at greatest risk for renal injury are those with pre-existing renal impairment, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and/or ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Kidney function should be monitored closely for any signs of potential renal injuries soon after initiating treatment with these agents, especially in high-risk populations. In addition, healthcare practitioners should adequately warn patients of the signs and symptoms of serious renal toxicity, and of the need for them to see their physician promptly if they occur. Celecoxib and rofecoxib are not recommended for use in patients with advanced renal disease.

12244038|t|Gemfibrozil, a lipid-lowering drug, inhibits the induction of nitric-oxide synthase in human astrocytes.
12244038|a|Gemfibrozil, a lipid-lowering drug, inhibited cytokine-induced production of NO and the expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) in human U373MG astroglial cells and primary astrocytes. Similar to gemfibrozil, clofibrate, another fibrate drug, also inhibited the expression of iNOS. Inhibition of human iNOS promoter-driven luciferase activity by gemfibrozil in cytokine-stimulated U373MG astroglial cells suggests that this compound inhibits the transcription of iNOS. Since gemfibrozil is known to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha), we investigated the role of PPAR-alpha in gemfibrozil-mediated inhibition of iNOS. Gemfibrozil induced peroxisome proliferator-responsive element (PPRE)-dependent luciferase activity, which was inhibited by the expression of DeltahPPAR-alpha, the dominant-negative mutant of human PPAR-alpha. However, DeltahPPAR-alpha was unable to abrogate gemfibrozil-mediated inhibition of iNOS suggesting that gemfibrozil inhibits iNOS independent of PPAR-alpha. The human iNOS promoter contains consensus sequences for the binding of transcription factors, including interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) binding to interferon-stimulated responsive element (ISRE), signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) binding to gamma-activation site (GAS), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), activator protein-1 (AP-1), and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta); therefore, we investigated the effect of gemfibrozil on the activation of these transcription factors. The combination of interleukin (IL)-1beta and IFN-gamma induced the activation of NF-kappaB, AP-1, C/EBPbeta, and GAS but not that of ISRE, suggesting that IRF-1 may not be involved in cytokine-induced expression of iNOS in human astrocytes. Interestingly, gemfibrozil strongly inhibited the activation of NF-kappaB, AP-1, and C/EBPbeta but not that of GAS in cytokine-stimulated astroglial cells. These results suggest that gemfibrozil inhibits the induction of iNOS probably by inhibiting the activation of NF-kappaB, AP-1, and C/EBPbeta and that gemfibrozil, a prescribed drug for humans, may further find its therapeutic use in neuroinflammatory diseases.

12512695|t|Vascular effects of COX inhibition and AT1 receptor blockade in transgenic rats harboring mouse renin-2 gene.
12512695|a|Ang II-induced endothelial dysfunction is associated with perivascular inflammation and increased superoxide production in the vascular wall. The present study examined the role of cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-synthetized eicosanoids in the pathogenesis of Ang II-induced endothelial dysfunction in transgenic rats harboring mouse renin-2 gene (mREN2 rats). Five-to-six-week-old, heterozygous mREN2 rats received the following drug regimens for 8 weeks: 1) vehicle, 2) cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor (MF-tricyclic [3-(3,4-difluorophenyl)-4-(4-(methylsulfonyl) phenyl)-2(5H)-furanone], 14 mg/kg p.o.), 3) COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor (sulindac, 14 mg/kg p.o.), 4) angiotensin II receptor antagonist (losartan 40 mg/kg p.o.). Normotensive Sprague Dawley (SD) rats served as controls. In vitro vascular responses of the descending aorta and renal artery were studied using organ bath system. mREN2 rats developed pronounced hypertension which was associated with impaired endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vascular relaxations in the aorta. In contrast, the relaxation responses of the renal arteries remained largely unchanged in mREN2 rats. Urinary NO, excretion, a marker of total body NO generation, was also decreased in mREN2 rats. Neither non-selective COX inhibitor sulindac nor COX-2 selective MF-tricyclic were capable of preventing Ang II-induced hypertension or endothelial dysfunction in mREN2 rats, whereas ATi receptor antagonist losartan completely normalized blood pressure, vascular relaxation responses as well as urinary NOx excretion. Our findings indicate that NO synthesis and/or bioavailability as well as the sensitivity of arterial smooth muscle cells to NO are decreased in mREN2 rats. The present study also demonstrated that COX does not play a central role in the pathogenesis of Ang II-induced endothelial dysfunction in mREN2 rats.

12566304|t|Sulindac sulfide inhibits epidermal growth factor-induced phosphorylation of extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 and Bad in human colon cancer cells.
12566304|a|Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including sulindac are promising chemopreventive agents for colorectal cancer. Sulindac and selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors cause regression of colonic polyps in familial polyposis patients. Sulindac induces apoptotic cell death in cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. In tumor cells, activation of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 results in phosphorylation of several ERK1/2 effectors, including the proapoptotic protein Bad. Phosphorylation of Ser112 by ERK1/2 inactivates Bad and protects the tumor cell from apoptosis. Sulindac metabolites and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs selectively inhibit ERK1/2 phosphorylation in human colon cancer cells. In this study we show that epidermal growth factor (EGF) strongly induces phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Bad in HT29 colon cancer cells. EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK and Bad is blocked by pretreatment with U0126, a selective MAP kinase kinase (MKK)1/2 inhibitor. Similarly, pretreatment with sulindac sulfide blocks the ability of EGF to induce ERK1/2 and Bad phosphorylation, but also down-regulates total Bad but not ERK1/2 protein levels. The ability of sulindac to block ERK1/2 signaling by the EGF receptor may account for at least part of its potent growth-inhibitory effects against cancer cells.

12795776|t|A comparison of the beta1-selectivity of three beta1-selective beta-blockers.
12795776|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative beta1-selectivity of three beta-blockers (nebivolol, bisoprolol and atenolol), administered orally at normal therapeutic doses, by assessing their impact on the beta2-mediated, haemodynamic and biochemical responses to a terbutaline infusion, which decreases serum potassium and increases serum glucose and insulin. METHODS: Twenty-four healthy volunteers (14 men, 10 women), with no history of respiratory disease, attended on five separate occasions; beta-blockers (nebivolol 5 mg, bisoprolol 10 mg, atenolol 50 and 100 mg) or placebo were supplied in random order. Three baseline blood samples were collected at 65-85 min post-beta-blocker. A 60-min terbutaline infusion was started 90 min after taking the beta-blocker. Blood samples were taken and blood pressure and heart rate recorded at 15 min intervals up to 30-min post-infusion. Blood samples were analysed for serum potassium, glucose and insulin concentrations. RESULTS: Terbutaline increased heart rate. Pretreatment with nebivolol caused a modest and non-significant reduction in terbutaline-induced tachycardia whilst bisoprolol produced a more marked effect. Atenolol at both 50 and 100 mg doses caused a highly significant reduction in terbutaline-induced tachycardia. All active preparations had a comparable impact on the terbutaline-induced increase in systolic blood pressure, but the drugs had no impact on the changes produced in diastolic blood pressure. After pretreatment with placebo, the terbutaline infusion caused a significant decrease in serum potassium and increases in serum glucose and insulin. Pretreatment with nebivolol had no discernible effect on potassium compared with placebo. In contrast, when compared with either placebo or nebivolol, bisoprolol (P &lt; 0.01) and both doses of atenolol (P &lt; 0.001) significantly attenuated the hypokalaemic effect of terbutaline. Treatment with nebivolol and bisoprolol modestly but significantly reduced the terbutaline-induced increases in glucose (P &lt; 0.05). The blocking effects of both doses of atenolol were highly significant (P &lt; 0.001) when compared with placebo and also significant (P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.01, respectively) when compared with nebivolol and bisoprolol. A similar pattern of responses with the different beta-blocker treatments was observed for the effects on insulin concentrations during the terbutaline infusion. CONCLUSION: The beta1-selectivity of three different beta1-blockers has been demonstrated in healthy volunteers using the blocking of biochemical and haemodynamic responses to a beta2 stimulus. Terbutaline alone caused an increase in heart rate, a rise in systolic blood pressure, a fall in serum potassium and a rise in both serum glucose and insulin. In this study, for both haemodynamic and biochemical responses, atenolol 100 mg had the greatest beta2-blocking effect, nebivolol 5 mg the least. Bisoprolol 10 mg and atenolol 50 mg had intermediate effects; bisoprolol was the more beta1-selective of these two.

12801482|t|Glucosamine sulfate modulates the levels of aggrecan and matrix metalloproteinase-3 synthesized by cultured human osteoarthritis articular chondrocytes.
12801482|a|OBJECTIVE: The functional integrity of articular cartilage is determined by a balance between chondrocyte biosynthesis of extracellular matrix and its degradation. In osteoarthritis (OA), the balance is disturbed by an increase in matrix degradative enzymes and a decrease in biosynthesis of constitutive extracellular matrix molecules, such as collagen type II and aggrecan. In this study, we examined the effects of the sulfate salt of glucosamine (GS) on the mRNA and protein levels of the proteoglycan aggrecan and on the activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 in cultured human OA articular chondrocytes. DESIGN: Freshly isolated chondrocytes were obtained from knee cartilage of patients with OA. Levels of aggrecan and MMP-3 were determined in culture media by employing Western blots after incubation with GS at concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 200 microM. Zymography (casein) was performed to confirm that effects observed at the protein level were reflected at the level of enzymatic activity. Northern hybridizations were used to examine effects of GS on levels of aggrecan and MMP-3 mRNA. Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) assays were performed on the cell layers to determine levels of cell-associated GAG component of proteoglycans. RESULTS: Treatment of OA chondrocytes with GS (1.0-150 microM) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in aggrecan core protein levels, which reached 120% at 150 microM GS. These effects appeared to be due to increased expression of the corresponding gene as indicated by an increase in aggrecan mRNA levels in response to GS. MMP-3 levels decreased (18-65%) as determined by Western blots. Reduction of MMP-3 protein was accompanied by a parallel reduction in enzymatic activity. GS caused a dose-dependent increase (25-140%) in cell-associated GAG content. Chondrocytes obtained from 40% of OA patients failed to respond to GS. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that GS can stimulate mRNA and protein levels of aggrecan core protein and, at the same time, inhibit production and enzymatic activity of matrix-degrading MMP-3 in chondrocytes from OA articular cartilage. These results provide a cogent molecular mechanism to support clinical observations suggesting that GS may have a beneficial effect in the prevention of articular cartilage loss in some patients with OA.

12844134|t|Beta 1-adrenergic receptor polymorphisms and antihypertensive response to metoprolol.
12844134|a|OBJECTIVES: Marked interpatient variability exists in blood pressure response to beta-blocker monotherapy. We tested the hypothesis that 2 common polymorphisms in the gene for beta(1)-adrenergic receptor are associated with antihypertensive response to metoprolol in patients with uncomplicated hypertension. METHODS: Forty hypertensive men and women aged 35 to 65 years were studied. Baseline studies included 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Patients took 50 mg metoprolol twice daily with weekly titration to response or 200 mg twice daily. After a minimum of 4 weeks at stable dose, treatment phase 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was repeated. The codon 49 and 389 genotypes for beta(1)-adrenergic receptor were determined by polymerase chain reaction with restriction fragment length polymorphism. Multilinear regression was performed to determine the impact of genotype and other variables on blood pressure response to metoprolol. RESULTS: Patients homozygous for Arg at codon 389 had a nearly 3-fold greater reduction in daytime diastolic blood pressure (-13.3% +/- 8.4% versus -4.5% +/- 8.2%, P =.0018) compared with those who carried the variant allele. The haplotype pair (diplotype) for beta(1)-adrenergic receptor was also a significant predictor of response, with patients having the Ser49Arg389/Ser49Arg389 diplotype demonstrating a decline in blood pressure of 14.7 mm Hg versus 0.5 mm Hg in patients with the Gly49Arg389/Ser49Gly389 diplotype. In multiregression analysis, baseline daytime diastolic blood pressure, codon 389 genotype, and codon 49 genotype were significant predictors of blood pressure after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that beta(1)-adrenergic receptor polymorphisms are important determinants of antihypertensive response to metoprolol. In the future, codon 49 and 389 genotypes or beta(1)-adrenergic receptor haplotypes might be used to predict the diastolic blood pressure response to metoprolol in patients with hypertension.

12963636|t|Phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma-deficient mice are protected from isoproterenol-induced heart failure.
12963636|a|BACKGROUND: We have recently shown that genetic inactivation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kgamma), the isoform linked to G-protein-coupled receptors, results in increased cardiac contractility with no effect on basal cell size. Signaling via the G-protein-coupled beta-adrenergic receptors has been implicated in cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, suggesting that PI3Kgamma might play a role in the pathogenesis of heart disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: To determine the role for PI3Kgamma in hypertrophy induced by G-protein-coupled receptors and cardiomyopathy, we infused isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist, into PI3Kgamma-deficient mice. Compared with controls, isoproterenol infusion in PI3Kgamma-deficient mice resulted in an attenuated cardiac hypertrophic response and markedly reduced interstitial fibrosis. Intriguingly, chronic beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation triggered impaired heart functions in wild-type mice, whereas PI3Kgamma-deficient mice retained their increased heart function and did not develop heart failure. The lack of PI3Kgamma attenuated the activation of Akt/protein kinase B and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 signaling pathways in cardiac myocytes in response to isoproterenol. beta1- and beta2-adrenergic receptor densities were decreased by similar amounts in PI3Kgamma-deficient and control mice, suggesting that PI3Kgamma isoform plays no role in the downregulation of beta-adrenergic receptors after chronic beta-adrenergic stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that PI3Kgamma is critical for the induction of hypertrophy, fibrosis, and cardiac dysfunction function in response to beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation in vivo. Thus, PI3Kgamma may represent a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of decreased cardiac function in heart failure.

1329582|t|Effects of nedocromil sodium and WEB 2086 on chemoattractant-stimulated neutrophil migration through cellular and noncellular barriers.
1329582|a|Nedocromil sodium (Tilade) is an effective therapeutic agent against asthma and has been shown to exhibit antiinflammatory activity in vitro; however, its mode of action is yet to be described fully. Using an in vitro assay designed to mimic the extravasation of neutrophils from the peripheral circulation through cellular barriers to sites of inflammation, the effect of nedocromil sodium on chemoattractant-stimulated neutrophil migration was examined. We also examined the effects of WEB 2086, a platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor antagonist, in parallel. Neutrophils and the cellular barrier were pretreated and/or co-incubated with nedocromil or WEB 2086 and the effects on neutrophil chemotaxis measured. In all treatments, nedocromil did not significantly affect chemotaxis through cellular or noncellular barriers to N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP), leukotriene B4 (LTB4), or PAF. In contrast, WEB 2086 inhibited PAF-induced neutrophil migration through both naked filters and endothelial and epithelial monolayers cultured on these filters. We conclude that while nedocromil has been shown to have inhibitory effects on neutrophils and is an effective therapeutic agent for asthma and inflammatory conditions, its activity is not primarily mediated by inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis. Platelet-activating factor antagonists may partially be effective in asthma through inhibitory effects on neutrophil chemotaxis.

14588118|t|Minocycline reduces cell death and improves functional recovery after traumatic spinal cord injury in the rat.
14588118|a|We examined the effects of minocycline, an anti-inflammatory drug, on functional recovery following spinal cord injury (SCI). Rats received a mild, weight-drop contusion injury to the spinal cord and were treated with the vehicle or minocycline at a dose of 90 mg/kg immediately after SCI and then twice at a dose of 45 mg/kg every 12 h. Injecting minocycline after SCI improved hind limb motor function as determined by the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor open field behavioral rating test. Twenty four to 38 days after SCI, BBB scores were significantly higher in minocycline-treated rats as compared with those in vehicle-treated rats. Morphological analysis showed that lesion size increased progressively in both vehicle-treated and minocycline-treated spinal cords. However, in response to treatment with minocycline, the lesion size was significantly reduced at 21-38 days after SCI when compared to the vehicle control. Minocycline treatment significantly reduced the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells 24 h after SCI as compared to that of the vehicle control. DNA gel electrophoresis also revealed a marked decrease in DNA laddering in response to treatment with minocycline. In addition, minocycline treatment significantly reduced the specific caspase-3 activity after SCI as compared to that of vehicle control. Furthermore, RT-PCR analyses revealed that minocycline treatment increased expression of interleukin-10 mRNA but decreased tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression. These data suggest that, after SCI, minocycline treatment modulated expression of cytokines, attenuated cell death and the size of lesions, and improved functional recovery in the injured rat. This approach may provide a therapeutic intervention enabling us to reduce cell death and improve functional recovery after SCI.

14659797|t|Serotonin 5-HT(2B) receptor loss of function mutation in a patient with fenfluramine-associated primary pulmonary hypertension.
14659797|a|OBJECTIVE: Appetite-suppressant drug fenfluramine is implicated in primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) but the molecular pathways that mediate this effect are unknown. A mouse model incriminates the serotonin 5-HT(2B) receptor but contrasts with other models where this receptor has been shown to mediate pulmonary arterial relaxation via nitric oxide production. METHODS: We analyzed the human 5-HT(2B) gene in 10 patients with appetite-suppressant drug-associated PPH. RESULTS: A mutation causing premature truncation of the protein product was found in one patient. The mutation was not found in 80 control subjects and no 5-HT(2B) mutation was found in 18 PPH patients not associated with appetite-suppressants. Functional analysis of the transfected receptor expressed either transiently in COS cells or stably in CHO cells demonstrated that the mutated receptor fails to activate the second messenger inositol-phosphates cascade and subsequent intracellular calcium release, in spite of normal expression at the cell membrane. The mutated receptor had no constitutive activity, and produced no dominant negative effect on the wild-type receptor. CONCLUSION: Loss of serotonin 5-HT(2B) receptor function may predispose to fenfluramine-associated PPH in man.

14751426|t|Effects of clozapine and its metabolites on the 5-HT2 receptor system in cortical and hippocampal cells in vitro.
14751426|a|PURPOSE: The goal of the present study was to determine the effects of clozapine (Cloz) and its metabolites norclozapine (Norcloz) and clozapine-N-oxide (Cloz-N-oxide) on the 5-HT(2) receptor system on the levels of protein and gene expression in in vitro systems of primary cortical cells of the rat and human hippocampal SHS5Y5 neuroblastoma cells. METHODS: Clinically relevant concentrations of Cloz (200/400 ng/ml) and its metabolites (200 ng/ml) were used for the examination of the effects of Cloz and its metabolites on serotoninergic 5-HT(2) receptor parameters (density, affinity and mRNA levels) as well as on glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA levels in primary cortical cells of the rat after treatment for 24 h under in vitro conditions. To compare the results to human cells, we also measured treatment-induced changes in 5-HT(2) and GAPDH mRNA levels in human hippocampal SHS5Y5 cells. RESULTS: A significant decrease was found in primary cortical cells for 5-HT(2) receptor density (Cloz 200/Cloz 400/Norcloz 200 and Cloz-N-oxide 200 vs. control) and 5-HT(2A) receptor mRNA levels (Cloz 200 vs. control). 5-HT(2A) receptor mRNA levels were also significantly reduced (Norcloz 200 vs. control) in SHS5Y5 cells. GAPDH mRNA levels were not affected. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study show that Cloz and Norcloz induce significant alterations on the 5-HT(2) receptor system in primary cortical cells of the rat and in human hippocampal cells.

15007532|t|FAUC 213, a highly selective dopamine D4 receptor full antagonist, exhibits atypical antipsychotic properties in behavioural and neurochemical models of schizophrenia.
15007532|a|RATIONALE: 2-[4-(4-Chlorophenyl)piperazin-1-ylmethyl]pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine (FAUC 213) is a highly selective antagonist at the dopamine D(4) receptor subtype. It was designed as a derivative of two partial antagonists and has been proven to be a complete antagonist in mitogenesis assay. OBJECTIVES: In the present study, FAUC 213 was examined for antipsychotic properties in animal models of behavioural neurobiology and neurochemistry. METHODS: Different concentrations of FAUC 213 were screened for effects on spontaneous, as well as amphetamine-induced, locomotor activity and apomorphine-induced prepulse disruption. The liability of causing extrapyramidal side effects was investigated in models of catalepsy and by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) detection of dopamine turnover in several brain regions. The application schedule was validated, and the bioavailability of the compound determined, by means of a HPLC-pharmacokinetic study. RESULTS: A significant effect in both the reduction of amphetamine-induced locomotor hyperactivity and the restoration of apomorphine-disrupted prepulse inhibition was found at 30 mg/kg. This dose proved not to be high enough to induce catalepsy or to increase dopamine turnover in the dorsal striatum, nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex. The selective D(4) antagonist FAUC 213, therefore, is not believed to mediate the above-mentioned effects via D(2) receptor antagonism, but a partial involvement of 5-HT(2)- and alpha(1)-receptors cannot be ruled out at present. CONCLUSIONS: We have gathered evidence that FAUC 213 exhibits atypical antipsychotic characteristics.

15044619|t|Glutathione S-transferase M1 and multidrug resistance protein 1 act in synergy to protect melanoma cells from vincristine effects.
15044619|a|Previous studies have shown that glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) can operate in synergy with efflux transporters, multi-drug resistance proteins (MRPs), to confer resistance to several carcinogens, mutagens and anticancer drugs. To address the poorly documented role of the GSTM1 in cancer chemoresistance, we used CAL1 human melanoma cells expressing no endogenous GSTM1 and a high level of MRP1. Cells were transfected with an expression vector containing the GSTM1 cDNA, and different clones were selected expressing different levels of GSTM1 (RT-PCR, Western blot, and enzyme activity). Cells overexpressing GSTM1 displayed a 3- to 4-fold increase in resistance to anticancer drugs vincristine (VCR) and chlorambucil (CHB) in proliferation, cytotoxic, and clonogenic survival assays. Inhibitors of MRP1 (sulfinpyrazone, verapamil) and GST (dicumarol, curcumin) completely reversed the GSTM1-associated resistance to VCR, indicating that a MRP efflux function is necessary to potentiate GSTM1-mediated resistance to VCR. Conversely, MRP1 inhibitors had no effect on the sensitivity to CHB. Using immunofluorescence assay, GSTM1 was also shown to protect microtubule network integrity from VCR-induced inhibition of microtubule polymerization. In conclusion, these results show that GSTM1 alone is involved in melanoma resistance to CHB, whereas it can act in synergy with MRP1 to protect cells from toxic effects of VCR.

15060759|t|Binding of (-)-[3H]-CGP12177 at two sites in recombinant human beta 1-adrenoceptors and interaction with beta-blockers.
15060759|a|To verify the hypothesis that the non-conventional partial agonist (-)-CGP12177 binds at two beta(1)-adrenoceptor sites, human beta(1)-adrenoceptors, expressed in CHO cells, were labelled with (-)-[(3)H]-CGP12177. We compared the binding affinity and antagonist potency of 12 clinically used beta-blockers against the cyclic AMP-enhancing effects of (-)-isoprenaline and (-)-CGP12177.(-)-[(3)H]-CGP12177 bound to a high affinity site (H; K(H)=0.47 nM) and low affinity site (L); K(L)=235 nM). (-)-[(3)H]-CGP12177 dissociated from the beta(1)-adrenoceptors with a fast component (k(off)=0.45 min(-1)), consistent with the L-site, and a slow component (k(off)=0.017-0.033 min(-1)), consistent with the H-site. (-)-Isoprenaline and (-)-CGP12177 caused 96-fold and 12-fold maximal increases in cyclic AMP levels with -logEC(50)M of 8.2 and 7.6. (-)-CGP12177 antagonised the effects of (-)-isoprenaline with a pK(B) of 9.9. The beta-blockers antagonised the effects of (-)-isoprenaline more than the effects of (-)-CGP12177 with potency ratios: (-)-atenolol 1,000, (+/-)-metropolol 676, (-)-pindolol 631, (-)-timolol 589, (+/-)-carvedilol 204, (+/-)-oxprenolol 138, (+/-)-sotalol 132, (-)-propranolol 120, (+/-)-bisoprolol 95, (+/-)-alprenolol 81, (+/-)-nadolol 68 and (-)-bupranolol 56. In intact cells the binding constants of beta-blockers, estimated from competition with 3-5 nM (-)-[(3)H]-CGP12177 (binding to the H-site), correlated with the corresponding affinities estimated from antagonism of the (-)-isoprenaline effects. We conclude that (-)-[(3)H]-CGP12177 binds at two sites in the recombinant beta(1)-adrenoceptor. (-)-CGP12177 is an antagonist of catecholamine effects through the H-site and a non-conventional partial agonist through the L-site. beta-blockers are more potent antagonists through the H-site than the L-site.

15078100|t|Kinetic mechanism of quinone oxidoreductase 2 and its inhibition by the antimalarial quinolines.
15078100|a|Quinone oxidoreductase 2 (QR2) purified from human red blood cells was recently shown to be a potential target of the quinoline antimalarial compounds [Graves et al., (2002) Mol. Pharmacol. 62, 1364]. QR2 catalyzes the two-electron reduction of menadione via the oxidation of N-alkylated or N-ribosylated nicotinamides. To investigate the mechanism and consequences of inhibition of QR2 by the quinolines further, we have used steady-state and transient-state kinetics to define the mechanism of QR2. Importantly, we have shown that QR2 when isolated from an overproducing strain of E. coli is kinetically equivalent to the enzyme from the native human red blood cell source. We observe ping-pong kinetics consistent with one substrate/inhibitor binding site that shows selectivity for the oxidation state of the FAD cofactor, suggesting that selective inhibition of the liver versus red blood cell forms of malaria may be possible. The reductant N-methyldihydronicotinamide and the inhibitor primaquine bind exclusively to the oxidized enzyme. In contrast, the inhibitors quinacrine and chloroquine bind exclusively to the reduced enzyme. The quinone substrate menadione, on the other hand, binds nonspecifically to both forms of the enzyme. Single-turnover kinetics of the reductive half-reaction are chemically and kinetically competent and confirm the inhibitor selectivity seen in the steady-state experiments. Our studies shed light on the possible in vivo potency of the quinolines and provide a foundation for future studies aimed at creating more potent QR2 inhibitors and at understanding the physiological significance of QR2.

15102535|t|Pharmacological profile of parecoxib: a novel, potent injectable selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor.
15102535|a|The antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic effects along with gastric safety profile of parecoxib, a novel, potent selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibiting prodrug, and those of ketorolac, a nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitor, were evaluated in various animal models. Parecoxib (up to 20 mg/kg, i.v.) had no effect in two acute pain models, namely, the acetic acid-induced writhing (visceral pain) and the formalin test (tonic pain). However, ketorolac (up to 10 mg/kg, i.v.) showed marked antinociceptive effects in these models. In the models of carrageenan-provoked inflammatory hyperalgesia and inflammation, and in lipopolysaccharide-induced pyrexia, parecoxib significantly reversed all the behavioral changes and it was found to be more potent than ketorolac. Further, ketorolac (10 mg/kg, i.v.) produced visible gastric lesions with prominent petechiae and hemorrhagic streaks. However, parecoxib was without any effect on gastric mucosa. The present results showed that the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, parecoxib, when administered parenterally, has potent antihyperalgesic, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic effects and has a better safety profile than with ketorolac, with sparing of cyclooxygenase-1 in the stomach in these animal models.

15123288|t|Ligand-selective inhibition of the interaction of steroid receptor coactivators and estrogen receptor isoforms.
15123288|a|Ligand-dependent nuclear hormone receptor (NR) signaling requires direct interaction between NR and the steroid receptor coactivators (SRC). Herein we utilize a library of SRC2 peptidomimetics to select for specific inhibitors of the interaction of SRC2 with the two estrogen receptor (ER) isoforms, ERalpha and ERbeta, in the presence of three different ligands: 17beta-estradiol, diethylstilbesterol, and genistein. The pattern of inhibitor selectivity for each ER isoform varied depending upon which ligand was present, thus demonstrating that the ligands exert unique allosteric effects upon the surface of the SRC binding pocket. Several of the lead compounds are highly (&gt;100-fold) selective for blocking the binding of SRC2 to ERalpha, in preference to ERbeta, in the presence of one ligand and therefore may prove useful for decoupling ERbeta signaling from ERalpha signaling.

15148258|t|Inhibition of cardiac HERG currents by the DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor amsacrine: mode of action.
15148258|a|1 The topoisomerase II inhibitor amsacrine is used in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia. Although most anticancer drugs are believed not to cause acquired long QT syndrome (LQTS), concerns have been raised by reports of QT interval prolongation, ventricular fibrillation and death associated with amsacrine treatment. Since blockade of cardiac human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) potassium currents is an important cause of acquired LQTS, we investigated the acute effects of amsacrine on cloned HERG channels to determine the electrophysiological basis for its proarrhythmic potential. 2 HERG channels were heterologously expressed in human HEK 293 cells and Xenopus laevis oocytes, and the respective potassium currents were recorded using patch-clamp and two-microelectrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology. 3 Amsacrine blocked HERG currents in HEK 293 cells and Xenopus oocytes in a concentration-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 209.4 nm and 2.0 microm, respectively. 4 HERG channels were primarily blocked in the open and inactivated states, and no additional voltage dependence was observed. Amsacrine caused a negative shift in the voltage dependence of both activation (-7.6 mV) and inactivation (-7.6 mV). HERG current block by amsacrine was not frequency dependent. 5 The S6 domain mutations Y652A and F656A attenuated (Y652A) or abolished (F656A, Y652A/F656A) HERG current blockade, indicating that amsacrine binding requires a common drug receptor within the pore-S6 region. 6 In conclusion, these data demonstrate that the anticancer drug amsacrine is an antagonist of cloned HERG potassium channels, providing a molecular mechanism for the previously reported QTc interval prolongation during clinical administration of amsacrine.

15161930|t|Structural basis for the deactivation of the estrogen-related receptor gamma by diethylstilbestrol or 4-hydroxytamoxifen and determinants of selectivity.
15161930|a|The estrogen-related receptor (ERR) gamma behaves as a constitutive activator of transcription. Although no natural ligand is known, ERRgamma is deactivated by the estrogen receptor (ER) agonist diethylstilbestrol and the selective ER modulator 4-hydroxytamoxifen but does not significantly respond to estradiol or raloxifene. Here we report the crystal structures of the ERRgamma ligand binding domain (LBD) complexed with diethylstilbestrol or 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Antagonist binding to ERRgamma results in a rotation of the side chain of Phe-435 that partially fills the cavity of the apoLBD. The new rotamer of Phe-435 displaces the "activation helix" (helix 12) from the agonist position observed in the absence of ligand. In contrast to the complexes of the ERalpha LBD with 4-hydroxytamoxifen or raloxifene, helix 12 of antagonist-bound ERRgamma does not occupy the coactivator groove but appears to be completely dissociated from the LBD body. Comparison of the ligand-bound LBDs of ERRgamma and ERalpha reveals small but significant differences in the architecture of the ligand binding pockets that result in a slightly shifted binding position of diethylstilbestrol and a small rotation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen in the cavity of ERRgamma relative to ERalpha. Our results provide detailed molecular insight into the conformational changes occurring upon binding of synthetic antagonists to the constitutive orphan receptor ERRgamma and reveal structural differences with ERs that explain why ERRgamma does not bind estradiol or raloxifene and will help to design new selective antagonists.

15198480|t|Six missense mutations of the epithelial sodium channel beta and gamma subunits in Japanese hypertensives.
15198480|a|Liddle's syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by sodium-sensitive early hypertension and mutations in either the beta- or gamma-subunit of the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel encoded by SCNN1B and SCNN1G. We sequenced the 381 bp-coding regions in exon 13 of SCNN1B and the 381 bp-coding regions in exon 12 of SCNN1G in 948 and 953 Japanese patients with hypertension, respectively. In the SCNN1B gene, we identified three missense mutations, P592S (n=3), T594M (n=2), and E632K (n=1) in a heterozygous state in addition to four synonymous ones, Ile515 (n=1), Ser520 (n=19), Ser533 (n=1), and Thr594 (n=11). In the SCNN1G gene, we identified three missense mutations, A578V (n=1), P603S (n=1), and L609F (n=1) in a heterozygous state in addition to two synonymous ones, Ile550 (n=1) and Leu649 (n= 91, heterozygous; n=2, homozygous). We did not identify the same mutations previously reported in Liddle's syndrome kindreds. Two of the six hypertensive patients with missense mutation in the SCNN1B gene showed atypical renin and aldosterone levels, though one of them was diagnosed with renovascular hypertension. One patient with T594M in the SCNN1B gene was resistant to hypertension. The roles of these missense mutations in the SCNN1B or SCNN1G gene identified in hypertensive patients are not clear in the pathogenesis of hypertension and the regulation of electrolytes. Thus, further investigation of these mutations, including functional analyses, will be needed.

15306222|t|Carvedilol selectively inhibits oscillatory intracellular calcium changes evoked by human alpha1D- and alpha1B-adrenergic receptors.
15306222|a|BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence from clinical trials indicates that carvedilol, an antagonist of alpha1- and beta-adrenergic receptors (ARs), provides an effective treatment for chronic heart failure, whereas nonselective alpha1-AR blockade has an adverse outcome in this disease. It is, however, not clear whether carvedilol exhibits a subtype-dependent impact on three distinct alpha1-adrenergic receptors (alpha1-ARs). METHODS AND RESULTS: We determined binding properties of human ARs for carvedilol using HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells expressing a single AR subtype. Our results showed that the affinities of alpha1D-AR and alpha1B-AR for carvedilol are higher than that of the beta1-AR subtype, a major target in heart failure treatment. The affinity rank order and pKi values of ARs for carvedilol were as follows: alpha1D-AR (8.9)&gt;alpha1B-AR (8.6)&gt;beta1-AR (8.4)&gt;beta2-AR (8.0)&gt;alpha1A-AR (7.9)?alpha2C-AR (5.9)&gt;alpha2B-AR (5.5)&gt;alpha2A-AR (5.3). Furthermore, temporal kinetics of intracellular calcium signaling mediated via alpha1D- and alpha1B-ARs, but not via alpha1A-AR (P&lt;0.01), showed oscillatory patterns with frequencies ranging from 0.3 to 3 per minute in human smooth muscle and HEK293 cells, which were inhibited by the therapeutic concentrations of carvedilol (10 nM) in a subtype-dependent manner. When oscillatory alpha1B-AR and non-oscillatory alpha1A-AR were co-expressed and heteromer receptors were detected with bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and co-immunoprecipitation, carvedilol suppressed only oscillatory component of global cytosolic free calcium change. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that in addition to beta-ARs, receptor inhibition by carvedilol is directed to alpha1-ARs, preferably to alpha1D- and alpha1B-AR-mediated signaling events, including intracellular calcium oscillations in vascular smooth muscle.

15353592|t|Different functional roles of T1R subunits in the heteromeric taste receptors.
15353592|a|The T1R receptors, a family of taste-specific class C G protein-coupled receptors, mediate mammalian sweet and umami tastes. The structure-function relationships of T1R receptors remain largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate the different functional roles of T1R extracellular and transmembrane domains in ligand recognition and G protein coupling. Similar to other family C G protein-coupled receptors, the N-terminal Venus flytrap domain of T1R2 is required for recognizing sweeteners, such as aspartame and neotame. The G protein coupling requires the transmembrane domain of T1R2. Surprisingly, the C-terminal transmembrane domain of T1R3 is required for recognizing sweetener cyclamate and sweet taste inhibitor lactisole. Because T1R3 is the common subunit in the sweet taste receptor and the umami taste receptor, we tested the interaction of lactisole and cyclamate with the umami taste receptor. Lactisole inhibits the activity of the human T1R1/T1R3 receptor, and, as predicted, blocked the umami taste of l-glutamate in human taste tests. Cyclamate does not activate the T1R1/T1R3 receptor by itself, but potentiates the receptor's response to l-glutamate. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the different functional roles of T1R3 and T1R2 and the presence of multiple ligand binding sites on the sweet taste receptor.

15465035|a|Adaptation to hypoxia and maintenance of O(2) homeostasis involve a wide range of responses that occur at different organizational levels in the body. One of the most important transcription factors that activate the expression of O(2)-regulated genes is hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). Nitric oxide (NO) mediates a variety of biological effects including relaxation of blood vessels and cytotoxicity of activated macrophages. We investigated the effect of the clinically used nitrates nitroglycerin (NTG), isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) on HIF-1-mediated transcriptional responses to hypoxia. We demonstrate that among the three nitrates, only SNP inhibits HIF-1 activation in response to hypoxia. In contrast, NTG or ISDN does not affect HIF-1 activity. SNP inhibits the accumulation of HIF-1alpha, the regulatory subunit of HIF-1, and the transcriptional activation of HIF-1alpha via a mechanism that is not dependent on either NO or soluble guanylate cyclase.

15618715|t|Potential cholestatic activity of various therapeutic agents assessed by bile canalicular membrane vesicles isolated from rats and humans.
15618715|a|The active transport of solutes mediated by the bile salt export pump (BSEP/ABCB11) and multidrug resistance associated protein-2 (MRP2/ABCC2) are thought to involve bile acid-dependent and -independent bile formation, respectively. To evaluate the potential of therapeutic agents as inhibitors of such transporters on bile canalicular membranes, we examined the inhibition of the primary active transport of typical substrates by 15 drugs, clinically known to cause cholestasis in canalicular membrane vesicles. The inhibition by most of the compounds in rat canalicular membrane vesicles (CMVs) was minimal or observed at much higher concentrations than obtained in clinical situations. However, cloxacillin, cyclosporin A and midecamycin inhibited BSEP, and cyclosporin A and midecamycin inhibited MRP2 with an inhibition constant close to the clinical concentration. By comparing the inhibition potential between rat and human CMVs, the inhibition of BSEP- and MRP2-mediated transport by midecamycin and cyclosporin A was relatively similar whereas the inhibitory effect on BSEP-mediated transport by cloxacillin and glibenclamide was more marked in humans than in rats. These results suggest that the majority of cholestasis-inducing drugs have a minimal inhibitory effect on rat BSEP and MRP2 although species differences in inhibitory potential should be considered, especially in the case of BSEP.

15650315|t|Pranlukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, inhibits interleukin-5 production via a mechanism distinct from leukotriene receptor antagonism.
15650315|a|BACKGROUND: Pranlukast, a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLTR1) antagonist, inhibits not only airway smooth muscle contraction, but also allergic inflammation. The aim of this study was to determine the mechanism of pranlukast-induced interleukin-5 (IL-5) inhibition in allergic inflammation. METHODS: Surgically resected human lung tissue was passively sensitized in vitro with mite-allergen-sensitized sera, followed by stimulation with mite allergen after pretreatment of the tissue with pranlukast, dexamethasone, or both. The IL-5 protein level in the culture medium was measured, and in situ hybridization of IL-5 and CysLTR1 mRNA was performed using lung tissues. RESULTS: Pretreatment of lung tissues with pranlukast alone significantly decreased the amount of IL-5 protein in the culture medium by 40%. The combination of pranlukast and dexamethasone synergistically enhanced this effect. Quantitative in situ hybridization with image analysis revealed abundant expression of IL-5 mRNA in eosinophils, lymphocytes, and mast cells in sensitized and allergen-stimulated lung tissues. CysLTR1 mRNA was detected in macrophages, smooth muscle cells, eosinophils, and mast cells, but was less expressed in lymphocytes. Pranlukast-induced inhibition of IL-5 mRNA expression was noted in various cells, irrespective of their CysLTR1 mRNA expression status. In addition, cysteinyl leukotrienes per se failed to upregulate the IL-5 production. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that pranlukast inhibits IL-5 synthesis via a mechanism distinct from CysLTR1 antagonism.

15673388|t|Further insights into the effect of quinidine in short QT syndrome caused by a mutation in HERG.
15673388|a|INTRODUCTION: The principal aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of quinidine in suppressing IKr in vitro and in modulating the rate dependence of the QT interval in the "SQT1" form of the short QT syndrome. METHODS AND RESULTS: Graded-intensity bicycle exercise testing was performed off drug in three patients and during oral quinidine in two patients with short QT syndrome and compared to a control group of healthy normal subjects. The in vitro effects of quinidine on currents in patch clamp technique were investigated. Off drugs QTpV3/heart rate correlation is much weaker in patients with short QT syndrome, and QTpV3 shortens less with heart rate increase compared to normal subjects. In addition to prolonging the QT interval into the normal range, quinidine restored the heart rate dependence of the QT interval toward a range of adaptation reported for normal subjects. Data from heterologous expression of wild-type and mutant HERG genes indicate the mutation causes a 20-fold increase in IC50 of d-sotalol but only a 5.8-fold increase in IC50 of quinidine. CONCLUSION: Oral quinidine is effective in suppressing the gain of function in IKr responsible for some cases of short QT syndrome with a mutation in HERG and thus restoring normal rate dependence of the QT interval and rendering ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation noninducible.

15686475|t|Effect of apocalmodulin on recombinant human brain glutamic acid decarboxylase.
15686475|a|In this work, we report that the recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-human L-glutamic acid decarboxylase (HGAD) isoforms, 65-kDa L-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) (GST-HGAD65) fusion protein or free truncated HGAD65, were activated by apocalmodulin (ApoCaM) to an extent of 60%. Both truncated forms of GAD67 (tGAD67), HGAD67(Delta1-70) and HGAD67(Delta1-90), were markedly activated by ApoCaM to an extent of 141 and 85%, respectively, while GST-HGAD67 was not significantly affected. The activation appears to be due to an increase of GAD affinity for its cofactor, pyridoxal phosphate (PLP). This conclusion is based on the following observations. Firstly, the V(max) of GAD was increased when ApoCaM was present whereas the affinity for the substrate, glutamate, was not affected. Secondly, the affinity of GAD for PLP was increased in the presence of ApoCaM. Thirdly, results from calmodulin-agarose affinity column chromatography studies indicated a direct interaction or binding between ApoCaM and GAD. Fourthly, ApoCaM was found to be copurified with GAD65/GAD67 by anti-GAD65/67 immunoaffinity column using rat brain extract. Hence, it is proposed that a conformational change is induced when ApoCaM interacts with GAD65 or tGAD67, resulting in an increase of GAD affinity for PLP and the activation of GAD. The physiological significance of the interaction between GAD and ApoCaM is discussed.

15723099|t|The dextromethorphan analog dimemorfan attenuates kainate-induced seizures via sigma1 receptor activation: comparison with the effects of dextromethorphan.
15723099|a|In a previous study, we demonstrated that a dextromethorphan analog, dimemorfan, has neuroprotective effects. Dextromethorphan and dimemorfan are high-affinity ligands at sigma1 receptors. Dextromethorphan has moderate affinities for phencyclidine sites, while dimemorfan has very low affinities for such sites, suggesting that these sites are not essential for the anticonvulsant actions of dimemorfan. Kainate (KA) administration (10 mg kg(-1), i.p.) produced robust convulsions lasting 4-6 h in rats. Pre-treatment with dimemorfan (12 or 24 mg kg(-1)) reduced seizures in a dose-dependent manner. Dimemorfan pre-treatment also attenuated the KA-induced increases in c-fos/c-jun expression, activator protein (AP)-1 DNA-binding activity, and loss of cells in the CA1 and CA3 fields of the hippocampus. These effects of dimemorfan were comparable to those of dextromethorphan. The anticonvulsant action of dextromethorphan or dimemorfan was significantly counteracted by a selective sigma1 receptor antagonist BD 1047, suggesting that the anticonvulsant action of dextromethorphan or dimemorfan is, at least in part, related to sigma1 receptor-activated modulation of AP-1 transcription factors. We asked whether dimemorfan produces the behavioral side effects seen with dextromethorphan or dextrorphan (a phencyclidine-like metabolite of dextromethorphan). Conditioned place preference and circling behaviors were significantly increased in mice treated with phencyclidine, dextrorphan or dextromethorphan, while mice treated with dimemorfan showed no behavioral side effects. Our results suggest that dimemorfan is equipotent to dextromethorphan in preventing KA-induced seizures, while it may lack behavioral effects, such as psychotomimetic reactions.

15732037|t|Carvedilol modulates the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor in a rat model of volume-overload heart failure.
15732037|a|BACKGROUND: The use of beta-blockers has emerged as a beneficial treatment for congestive heart failure. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) is tightly regulated in the ventricular myocardium. However, the expression of HIF-1alpha in chronic heart failure resulting from volume overload and after treatment with beta-blocker is little known. METHODS AND RESULTS: To test the hypothesis that HIF-1alpha plays a role in the failing myocardium because of volume overload, an aorta-caval shunt was created for 4 weeks in adult Sprague-Dawley rats to induce volume-overload heart failure. Carvedilol at 50 mg/kg body weight per day after surgery was given. The heart weight and body weight ratio increased from 2.6 +/- 0.3 in the sham group to 3.9 +/- 0.7 (P &lt; .001) in the shunt group. Left ventricular end-diastolic dimension increased from 6.5 +/- 0.5 mm to 8.7 +/- 0.6 mm (P &lt; .001). Treatment with carvedilol in the shunt group reversed the heart weight and ventricular dimension to the baseline values. Western blot showed that HIF-1alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) proteins were upregulated and nerve growth factor-beta (NGF-beta) downregulated in the shunt group. Real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that mRNA of HIF-1alpha, VEGF, and BNP increased and mRNA of NGF-beta decreased in the shunt group. Treatment with carvedilol reversed both protein and mRNA of HIF-1alpha, VEGF, BNP, and NGF-beta to the baseline values. Increased immunohistochemical labeling of HIF-1alpha, VEGF, and BNP in the ventricular myocardium was observed in the shunt group and carvedilol again normalized the labeling. CONCLUSION: HIF-1alpha and VEGF mRNA and protein expression were upregulated in the rat model of volume-overload heart failure. Treatment with carvedilol is associated with a reversal of abnormal regulation of HIF-1alpha and VEGF in the failing ventricular myocardium.

15805193|t|Genetic predictors of the maximum doses patients receive during clinical use of the anti-epileptic drugs carbamazepine and phenytoin.
15805193|a|Phenytoin and carbamazepine are effective and inexpensive anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). As with many AEDs, a broad range of doses is used, with the final "maintenance" dose normally determined by trial and error. Although many genes could influence response to these medicines, there are obvious candidates. Both drugs target the alpha-subunit of the sodium channel, encoded by the SCN family of genes. Phenytoin is principally metabolized by CYP2C9, and both are probable substrates of the drug transporter P-glycoprotein. We therefore assessed whether variation in these genes associates with the clinical use of carbamazepine and phenytoin in cohorts of 425 and 281 patients, respectively. We report that a known functional polymorphism in CYP2C9 is highly associated with the maximum dose of phenytoin (P = 0.0066). We also show that an intronic polymorphism in the SCN1A gene shows significant association with maximum doses in regular usage of both carbamazepine and phenytoin (P = 0.0051 and P = 0.014, respectively). This polymorphism disrupts the consensus sequence of the 5' splice donor site of a highly conserved alternative exon (5N), and it significantly affects the proportions of the alternative transcripts in individuals with a history of epilepsy. These results provide evidence of a drug target polymorphism associated with the clinical use of AEDs and set the stage for a prospective evaluation of how pharmacogenetic diagnostics can be used to improve dosing decisions in the use of phenytoin and carbamazepine. Although the case made here is compelling, our results cannot be considered definitive or ready for clinical application until they are confirmed by independent replication.

15860753|t|Glucocorticoid receptor nuclear translocation in airway cells after inhaled combination therapy.
15860753|a|Clinical evidence is accumulating for the efficacy of adding inhaled long-acting beta(2)-agonists (LABAs) to corticosteroids in asthma. Corticosteroids bind to cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), which then translocate to the nucleus where they regulate gene expression. This article reports the first evidence in vivo of an interaction between inhaled LABA and corticosteroid on GR nuclear translocation in human airway cells using immunocytochemistry. We initially demonstrated significant GR activation 60 minutes after inhalation of 800 microg beclomethasone dipropionate in six healthy subjects. Subsequently, we determined the effects of salmeterol and fluticasone propionate (FP) in seven steroid-naive patients with asthma. We observed dose-dependent GR activation with 100- and 500-microg doses of FP, and to a lesser extent with 50 microg salmeterol alone. However, combination therapy with 100 microg FP and salmeterol augmented the action of FP on GR nuclear localization. In vitro, salmeterol enhanced FP effects on GR nuclear translocation in epithelial and macrophage-like airway cell lines. In addition, salmeterol in combination with FP enhanced glucocorticoid response element (GRE)-luciferase reporter gene activity and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) and secretory leuko-proteinase inhibitor (SLPI) gene induction. Together, our data confirm that GR nuclear translocation may underlie the complementary interactions between LABAs and corticosteroids, although the precise signal transduction mechanisms remain to be determined.

15931068|t|TRPA1 and TRPM8 activation in humans: effects of cinnamaldehyde and menthol.
15931068|a|The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychophysical effects of both TRPA1 and TRPM8 activation in humans by application of either cinnamaldehyde or menthol. We applied 10% cinnamaldehyde or 40% menthol solutions on the forearm in 10 study participants. Quantitative sensory testing and laser Doppler imaging was performed before and after exposure to the compounds. Cinnamaldehyde evoked significant spontaneous pain and induced heat and mechanical hyperalgesia, cold hypoalgesia and a neurogenic axon reflex erythema. In contrast, TRPM8 activation by menthol produced no axon reflex reaction and resulted in cold hyperalgesia. We conclude that agonists of TRPA1 and TRPM8 channels produce strikingly different psychophysical patterns.

15942707|t|Carvedilol prevents cardiac hypertrophy and overexpression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor in pressure-overloaded rat heart.
15942707|a|The use of beta-blockers has emerged as a beneficial treatment for cardiac hypertrophy. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) is tightly regulated in the ventricular myocardium. However, the expression of HIF-1alpha in cardiac hypertrophy due to pressure overload and after treatment with beta-blocker is little known. To evaluate the effect of carvedilol on both myocardial HIF-1alpha expression and cardiac hypertrophy, infra-renal aortic banding was performed for 4 weeks in adult Sprague-Dawley rats to induce cardiac hypertrophy. Carvedilol at 50 mg/kg body weight per day after surgery was given. Heart weight and the ratio of heart weight and body weight increased significantly after aortic banding for 4 weeks in the absence of drug treatment. Mean arterial pressure increased from 80 +/- 9 mmHg in the sham group to 94 +/-5 mmHg (p &lt; 0.001) in the banding group. Echocardiography showed concentric hypertrophy after aortic banding. Mean arterial pressure decreased after treatment with carvedilol. The increased wall thickness and heart weight was reversed to normal by carvedilol. Western blot showed that HIF-1alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) proteins were up-regulated and nerve growth factor-beta (NGF-beta) down-regulated in the banding group. Treatment with valsartan, doxazosin, or N-acetylcysteine did not significantly affect HIF-1alpha and VEGF proteins expression in the banding groups. Real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that mRNA of HIF-1alpha, VEGF and BNP increased and mRNA of NGF-beta decreased in the banding group. Treatment with carvedilol reversed both protein and mRNA of HIF-1alpha, VEGF, BNP, and NGF-beta to the baseline values. Increased immunohistochemical labeling of HIF-1alpha, VEGF, and BNP in the ventricular myocardium was observed in the banding group and carvedilol again normalized the labeling. In conclusion, HIF-1alpha, VEGF, and BNP mRNA and protein expression were up-regulated, while NGF-beta mRNA and protein was downregulated in the rat model of pressure-overloaded cardiac hypertrophy. Treatment with carvedilol is associated with a reversal of abnormal regulation of HIF-1alpha, VEGF, BNP, and NGF-beta in the hypertrophic myocardium.

15974585|t|2-Arylpropionic CXC chemokine receptor 1 (CXCR1) ligands as novel noncompetitive CXCL8 inhibitors.
15974585|a|The CXC chemokine CXCL8/IL-8 plays a major role in the activation and recruitment of polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells at inflammatory sites. CXCL8 activates PMNs by binding the seven-transmembrane (7-TM) G-protein-coupled receptors CXC chemokine receptor 1 (CXCR1) and CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2). (R)-Ketoprofen (1) was previously reported to be a potent and specific noncompetitive inhibitor of CXCL8-induced human PMNs chemotaxis. We report here molecular modeling studies showing a putative interaction site of 1 in the TM region of CXCR1. The binding model was confirmed by alanine scanning mutagenesis and photoaffinity labeling experiments. The molecular model driven medicinal chemistry optimization of 1 led to a new class of potent and specific inhibitors of CXCL8 biological activity. Among these, repertaxin (13) was selected as a clinical candidate drug for prevention of post-ischemia reperfusion injury.

15982930|t|Thalidomide inhibits growth of tumors through COX-2 degradation independent of antiangiogenesis.
15982930|a|Thalidomide is an antiangiogenic drug and is clinically useful in a number of cancers. However, the molecular mechanism by which thalidomide exerts its antitumor effects is poorly understood. This study was designed to clarify the relationship between antiangiogenesis and antitumor effects of thalidomide and to explore the molecular mechanism for its antitumor activity. We evaluated the effects of thalidomide on the growth of human tumor cells expressing (MCF-7 and HL-60) or not expressing (HeLa and K562) COX-2 in vitro. We also studied the effects of thalidomide on COX-1, COX-2 or bcl-2 expression, TNFalpha, VEGF, GSH and cytochrome c in these cells. Thalidomide could inhibit tumor growth in a concentration-dependent manner in MCF-7 and HL-60; its IC50s for them were 18.36+/-2.34 and 22.14+/-2.15 microM, respectively, while this effect was not observed in HeLa and K562. Thalidomide reduced COX-2 expression accompanied by a decrease of bcl-2 protein, TNFalpha, VEGF, GSH and an increased cytochrome c, but had no effect on that of COX-1, in MCF-7 and HL-60. Moreover, cells not expressing COX-2 were insensitive to the growth-inhibitory and effects on cytokines of thalidomide. In our mouse xenograft model of OVCAR-3 and HCT-8, we found that thalidomide could decrease intratumoral microvessel density in both tumors; it exerted antitumor effects only on OVCAR-3 expressing COX-2 but did not on HCT-8 not expressing COX-2. Effect of thalidomide on COX-1 and COX-2 in vivo was consistent with that of in vitro. These results demonstrated that thalidomide might inhibit growth of tumors through COX-2 degradation independent of antiangiogenesis.

15991937|t|Losartan: a selective angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist for the treatment of heart failure.
15991937|a|Losartan (COZAAR) is the prototype of a new class of potent and selective angiotensin II (AII) type 1 (AT(1)) receptor antagonists with the largest published preclinical and clinical data base. Since all of the AII antagonists are selective for the AT(1) receptor, these drugs should exhibit similar cardiovascular effects. However, since the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles of these agents and their degree of affinity for the AT(1) receptor differ, it is likely that differences in clinical profiles between these drugs exist and will require investigation. Losartan (parent compound), has moderate affinity for the AT(1) receptor (competitive inhibition). Losartan is well-absorbed orally as an active drug and is rapidly converted via oxidation in the human liver to a more potent metabolite (designated E3174) with an affinity 20- to 30-times greater for the AT(1) receptor (non-competitive inhibition). E3174 has a half-life of 6 - 9 h; elimination is via renal and hepatic routes. Antihypertensive and, in heart failure patients, haemodynamic activity is observed over a 24 h period with once daily dosing. Over 6 million patients have been treated for hypertension with continued excellent tolerability. Clinical experience in heart failure is growing, and recent data suggest an improved survival with losartan versus captopril, a drug from the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor class with proven benefit in this population. The current comprehensive losartan clinical end-point programme (4 large scale morbidity/mortality trials) should provide evidence regarding the efficacy of direct blockade of the AT(1) receptor with losartan compared to standard therapy: 1) The Losartan Heart Failure Survival Study - ELITE II, 2) The Losartan Post-Myocardial Infarction Survival Study - OPTIMAAL, 3) The Losartan Hypertension Survival Study - LIFE and 4) The Losartan Renal Protection Study - RENAAL.

16010412|t|Potential of endogenous estrogen receptor beta to influence the selective ER modulator ERbeta complex.
16010412|a|The ratio of estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) to ERalpha can alter the estrogen-like properties of tamoxifen. Transient transfection of ERbeta cDNA into cells can decrease the estrogen-like properties of the ERalpha:tamoxifen complex, whereas an increase in the amount of ERbeta is associated with tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer. We have addressed each of these hypotheses by examining well characterized laboratory models. We determined whether changes in endogenous ERbeta are responsible for the estrogen-like or antiestrogenic properties of tamoxifen or raloxifene in MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with cDNAs for ERalpha or mutants D351G, D351Y. We found that the amount of ERbeta mRNA in separate, stable transfectants of mutant ERalpha cDNA was always &lt; 2% of ERalpha. Since at least a 50:50 mixture of ERalpha:ERbeta is needed to silence the tamoxifen:ERalpha complex, we conclude that insufficient ERbeta mRNA is available for selective ER modulation in stable transfectants of D351G and D351Y ERalpha. Similarly, to test the hypothesis that ERbeta is up-regulated and plays an important role during the development of tamoxifen-stimulated tumor growth, we quantitatively analyzed ERbeta and ERalpha mRNA in tamoxifen-naive (MCF-7:E2, ECC1:E2) and tamoxifen-stimulated tumors (MCF-7:TAM, EnCa 101:TAM). We found that ERbeta mRNA levels were not significantly elevated in tamoxifen-stimulated tumors and the ERalpha mRNA remained over 99% out of all ER species for all the tumors tested. The same results were also obtained when mRNA levels of ERbeta and ERalpha in a series of tamoxifen-naive and tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer was analyzed. We conclude that endogenous ERbeta may not play a dominant role in the modulation of the tamoxifen ERalpha complex, or in the development of tamoxifen-stimulated resistant tumor growth.

16018973|t|Niacin mediates lipolysis in adipose tissue through its G-protein coupled receptor HM74A.
16018973|a|A G-protein coupled receptor to niacin (nicotinic acid) was identified recently but the physiological/pharmacological role of the receptor remains poorly defined. We present our studies to demonstrate that HM74A, but not HM74, binds niacin at high affinities and effectively mediates Gi signaling events in human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells as well as in 3T3L1 adipocytes expressing HM74A. Furthermore, HM74A, but not HM74, expressed in differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes effectively mediated inhibition of lipolysis by niacin. Our results provided direct evidence indicating that HM74A, but not HM74, was sufficient to mediate anti-lipolytic effect of niacin in adipose tissue.

16322797|t|GPR109A (PUMA-G/HM74A) mediates nicotinic acid-induced flushing.
16322797|a|Nicotinic acid (niacin) has long been used as an antidyslipidemic drug. Its special profile of actions, especially the rise in HDL-cholesterol levels induced by nicotinic acid, is unique among the currently available pharmacological tools to treat lipid disorders. Recently, a G-protein-coupled receptor, termed GPR109A (HM74A in humans, PUMA-G in mice), was described and shown to mediate the nicotinic acid-induced antilipolytic effects in adipocytes. One of the major problems of the pharmacotherapeutical use of nicotinic acid is a strong flushing response. This side effect, although harmless, strongly affects patient compliance. In the present study, we show that mice lacking PUMA-G did not show nicotinic acid-induced flushing. In addition, flushing in response to nicotinic acid was also abrogated in the absence of cyclooxygenase type 1, and mice lacking prostaglandin D(2) (PGD(2)) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) receptors had reduced flushing responses. The mouse orthologue of GPR109A, PUMA-G, is highly expressed in macrophages and other immune cells, and transplantation of wild-type bone marrow into irradiated PUMA-G-deficient mice restored the nicotinic acid-induced flushing response. Our data clearly indicate that GPR109A mediates nicotinic acid-induced flushing and that this effect involves release of PGE(2) and PGD(2), most likely from immune cells of the skin.

16384941|t|Spectrum and frequency of mutations in IMPDH1 associated with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa and leber congenital amaurosis.
16384941|a|PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency and spectrum of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase type I (IMPDH1) mutations associated with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (RP), to determine whether mutations in IMPDH1 cause other forms of inherited retinal degeneration, and to analyze IMPDH1 mutations for alterations in enzyme activity and nucleic acid binding. METHODS: The coding sequence and flanking intron/exon junctions of IMPDH1 were analyzed in 203 patients with autosomal dominant RP (adRP), 55 patients with autosomal recessive RP (arRP), 7 patients with isolated RP, 17 patients with macular degeneration (MD), and 24 patients with Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). DNA samples were tested for mutations by sequencing only or by a combination of single-stranded conformational analysis and by sequencing. Production of fluorescent reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) was used to measure enzymatic activity of mutant IMPDH1 proteins. The affinity and the specificity of mutant IMPDH1 proteins for single-stranded nucleic acids were determined by filter-binding assays. RESULTS: Five different IMPDH1 variants, Thr116Met, Asp226Asn, Val268Ile, Gly324Asp, and His 372Pro, were identified in eight autosomal dominant RP families. Two additional IMPDH1 variants, Arg105Trp and Asn198Lys, were found in two patients with isolated LCA. None of the novel IMPDH1 mutants identified in this study altered the enzymatic activity of the corresponding proteins. In contrast, the affinity and/or the specificity of single-stranded nucleic acid binding were altered for each IMPDH1 mutant except the Gly324Asp variant. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in IMPDH1 account for approximately 2% of families with adRP, and de novo IMPDH1 mutations are also rare causes of isolated LCA. This analysis of the novel IMPDH1 mutants substantiates previous reports that IMPDH1 mutations do not alter enzyme activity and demonstrates that these mutants alter the recently identified single-stranded nucleic acid binding property of IMPDH. Studies are needed to further characterize the functional significance of IMPDH1 nucleic acid binding and its potential relationship to retinal degeneration.

16469680|t|Prevalence and mechanism of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced clinical relapse in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
16469680|a|BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: It has been variably suggested that nonselective NSAIDs and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 selective inhibitors aggravate or ameliorate clinical disease activity in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We assessed the effect of these drugs in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (n = 209) and the possible mechanisms. METHODS: First, patients with quiescent Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis received the non-NSAID analgesic acetaminophen (n = 26) and the conventional NSAIDs naproxen (n = 32), diclofenac (n = 29), and indomethacin (n = 22) for 4 weeks. The Harvey-Bradshaw index was used to define relapse. Second, to assess the mechanism of relapse, intestinal inflammation was quantitated (fecal calprotectin) before and during treatment (20 patients/group) with acetaminophen, naproxen (topical effect, COX-1 and -2 inhibitor), nabumetone (COX-1 and -2 inhibitor), nimesulide (selective COX-2 inhibitor), and low-dose aspirin (selective COX-1 inhibition). RESULTS: Nonselective NSAIDs were associated with a 17%-28% relapse rate within 9 days of ingestion. No patient had an early relapse on acetaminophen, nimesulide, or aspirin, whereas those on naproxen and nabumetone (20%) experienced relapse. These clinical relapses were associated with escalating intestinal inflammatory activity. CONCLUSIONS: NSAID ingestion is associated with frequent and early clinical relapse of quiescent inflammatory bowel disease, and the mechanism appears to be due to dual inhibition of the COX enzymes. Selective COX-2 inhibition with nimesulide and COX-1 inhibition with low-dose aspirin appear to be well-tolerated in the short-term.

16494569|t|Abnormally high plasma levels of vitamin B6 in children with autism not taking supplements compared to controls not taking supplements.
16494569|a|BACKGROUND: There have been many studies of the effect of high-dose supplementation of vitamin B6 on children and adults with autism, with all but one reporting benefits. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the biochemical basis for vitamin B6 therapy by measuring the level of total vitamin B6 in the plasma of unsupplemented children with autism spectrum disorder compared to unsupplemented control subjects. PARTICIPANTS: Children with autism spectrum disorders (n = 35, age 3-9 years) and unrelated typical children (n = 11, age 6-9 years), all from Arizona, were studied. (This includes the data from 24 children with autism from our previous study.) METHODOLOGY: A microbiologic assay was used to measure the level of total vitamin B6 (including phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms), in a blinded fashion. RESULTS: Children with autism had a 75% higher level of total vitamin B6 than the controls (medians of 56 versus 32 ng/mL, respectively, p = 0.00002). Most of the autistic children (77%) had levels that were more than 2 standard deviations above the median value of the controls. The autistic girls (n = 5) also had elevated levels (mean of 54.6 ng/mL, median of 60 ng/mL). DISCUSSION: These results are consistent with previous studies that found that: (1) pyridoxal kinase had a very low activity in children with autism and (2) pyridoxal 5 phosphate (PLP) levels are unusually low in children with autism. Thus, it appears that the low conversion of pyridoxal and pyridoxine to PLP results in low levels of PLP, which is the active cofactor for 113 known enzymatic reactions, including the formation of many key neurotransmitters. CONCLUSIONS: Total vitamin B6 is abnormally high in autism, consistent with previous reports of an impaired pyridoxal kinase for the conversion of pyridoxine and pyridoxal to PLP. This may explain the many published studies of benefits of high-dose vitamin B6 supplementation in some children and adults with autism.

16595573|t|Hepatic veno-occlusive disease associated with immunosuppressive cyclophosphamide dosing and roxithromycin.
16595573|a|OBJECTIVE: To report on a patient developing hepatic veno-occlusive disease while being treated with immunosuppressive doses of cyclophosphamide (&lt; or =2 mg/kg). CASE SUMMARY: A 66-year-old woman with autoimmune hemolytic anemia developed hepatic veno-occlusive disease while being treated with immunosuppressive cyclophosphamide 100 mg/day in combination with roxithromycin (total dose 600 mg/day). After all drugs were stopped, the patient recovered within 2 weeks. The Naranjo probability scale indicated a probable relationship between veno-occlusive disease and treatment with cyclophosphamide in this patient. DISCUSSION: Since roxithromycin inhibits CYP3A4, which is involved with cyclophosphamide metabolism, a drug-drug interaction could have been responsible. In addition, roxithromycin is an inhibitor of the drug transporter P-glycoprotein, possibly leading to accumulation of cyclophosphamide in endothelial cells. Alternatively, since cyclophosphamide has been reported to induce apoptosis, roxithromycin could have rendered endothelial cells more vulnerable for apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: In specific patients, cyclophosphamide can be associated with hepatic veno-occlusive disease at immunosuppressive doses.

16627864|t|Dobutamine improves liver function after hemorrhagic shock through induction of heme oxygenase-1.
16627864|a|RATIONALE: Induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protects the liver against reperfusion injury after hemorrhagic shock. Previous data suggest that the beta(1)-adrenoceptor agonist dobutamine induces HO-1 in hepatocytes. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the functional significance of dobutamine pretreatment for liver function after hemorrhagic shock in vivo. METHODS: Anesthetized rats received either Ringer's (Vehicle/Shock), 10 microg/kg/min of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor agonist dobutamine (Dob/Shock), or 10 microg/kg/min dobutamine and 500 microg/kg/min of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist esmolol (Dob/Esmolol/Shock) for 6 h. Hemorrhagic shock was induced thereafter (mean arterial pressure, 35 mm Hg for 90 min). Animals were resuscitated with shed blood and Ringer's. In addition, the HO pathway was blocked after dobutamine pretreatment with 10 micromol/kg tin-mesoporphyrin-IX (Dob/SnMP/Shock) or animals received 100 mg/kg of the carbon monoxide donor dichloromethane (DCM/Shock). MEASUREMENTS: Hepatocellular metabolism and liver blood flow were measured by plasma disappearance rate of indocyanine green (PDR(ICG)) as a sensitive marker of liver function. MAIN RESULTS: Pretreatment with dobutamine induced HO-1 in pericentral hepatocytes and improved PDR(ICG) (Vehicle/Shock: 11.7 +/- 8.12%/min vs. Dob/Shock: 19.7 +/- 2.46%/min, p = 0.006). Blockade of the HO pathway after preconditioning and the combined pretreatment with dobutamine and esmolol decreased PDR(ICG) (Dob/SnMP/Shock: 12.6 +/- 4.24%/min, p = 0.011; Dob/Esmolol/Shock: 10.2 +/- 4.34%/min, p = 0.008). Pretreatment with a carbon monoxide donor improved PDR(ICG) (DCM/Shock: 18 +/- 3.19%/min, p = 0.022) compared with Vehicle/Shock. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a beta(1)-adrenoceptor-dependent hepatic up-regulation of HO-1 and a better maintained hepatocellular function after hemorrhagic shock in animals pretreated with dobutamine. The improved hepatocellular function may be in part mediated by carbon monoxide because of up-regulation of HO-1. Pretreatment with dobutamine might be a potential means of pharmacologic preconditioning before ischemia-reperfusion of the liver.

16651698|t|Changes in submaxillary gland gene expression in F344 rats by multiple dosing of theophylline.
16651698|a|Multiple exposure to theophylline, a phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor, induces acinar hypertrophy in the salivary gland. This study examined the effect of theophylline on the gene expression of secretory proteins and phosphodiesterases in the submaxillary gland. Male F344 rats received saline or theophylline (50 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for 4 days. The gene expressions for the secretory protein, cystatin S (CysS), and PDE subfamilies 3A and 4D in the submaxillary gland were quantified using RT-PCR. Theophylline exposure resulted in a sustained increase in mRNA expression for CysS and PDE3A, but PDE4D gene expression was unchanged. Our results suggest that submaxillary hypertrophy is primarily caused by the enhanced transcription of CysS, and that the transcription of each PDE subfamily gene is regulated differently.

16819260|t|[Retinoid therapy for autoimmune diseases].
16819260|a|Retinoid is a collective term for compounds which bind to and activate retinoic acid receptors (RARalpha, beta, gamma and RXRalpha, beta, gamma), members of nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. The most important endogeneous retinoid is all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) which is an RARalpha, beta and gamma ligand. ATRA and its mimics have been in clinical use for treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and some skin diseases. Many synthetic retinoids have been developed and attempts to improve their medicinal properties have been made. Among them, tamibarotene (Am80) is an RARalpha- and RARbeta-specific (but RARgamma- and RXRs-nonbinding) synthetic retinoid that is effective in the treatment of psoriasis patients and relapsed APL. Experimentally, this compound is also active in animal models of rheumatoid arthritis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. On this background, possible application of retinoids for the treatment of autoimmune diseases was discussed. In particular, Th1 dominant autoimmune diseases may be the targets of the retinoids.

16867246|t|Association of DRD2 polymorphisms and chlorpromazine-induced extrapyramidal syndrome in Chinese schizophrenic patients.
16867246|a|AIM: Extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS) is most commonly affected by typical antipsychotic drugs that have a high affinity with the D2 receptor. Recently, many research groups have reported on the positive relationship between the genetic variations in the DRD2 gene and the therapeutic response in schizophrenia patients as a result of the role of variations in the receptor in modulating receptor expression. In this study, we evaluate the role DRD2 plays in chlorpromazine-induced EPS in schizophrenic patients. METHODS: We identified seven SNP(single nucleotide polymorphism) (-141Cins&gt;del, TaqIB, TaqID, Ser311Cys, rs6275, rs6277 and TaqIA) in the DRD2 gene in 146 schizophrenic inpatients (59 with EPS and 87 without EPS according to the Simpson-Angus Scale) treated with chlorpromazine after 8 weeks. The alleles of all loci were determined by PCR (polymerase chain reaction). RESULTS: Polymorphisms TaqID, Ser311Cys and rs6277 were not polymorphic in the population recruited in the present study. No statistical significance was found in the allele distribution of -141Cins&gt;del, TaqIB, rs6275 and TaqIA or in the estimated haplotypes (constituted by TaqIB, rs6275 and TaqIA) in linkage disequilibrium between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Our results did not lend strong support to the view that the genetic variation of the DRD2 gene plays a major role in the individually variable adverse effect induced by chlorpromazine, at least in Chinese patients with schizophrenia. Our results confirmed a previous study on the relationship between DRD2 and EPS in Caucasians.

16899342|t|The P/Q-type voltage-dependent calcium channel as pharmacological target in spinocerebellar ataxia type 6: gabapentin and pregabalin may be of therapeutic benefit.
16899342|a|Voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs) are heteromultimeric complexes that mediate calcium influx into cells in response to changes in membrane potential. The alpha1A subunit, encoded by the CACNA1A gene, is the pore-forming subunit specific to the neuronal P/Q-type VDCCs. These are implicated in fast excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. Their highest levels of expression are found in the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, and in the hippocampus. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA 6) is an autosomal dominant cerebellar degeneration that shares neuropathological findings with late-onset cortical cerebellar atrophy (CCA). It is caused by an abnormal expansion of a trinucleotide (CAG) repeat in exon 47 of CACNA1A, on chromosome 19p13. This translates into a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract of prolonged length in the carboxyl terminal of the alpha1A subunit. Heterologous expression of mutated alpha1A subunits results in increased channel inactivation in electrophysiological tests. No treatment is known to improve SCA 6 at present, as none of the available drugs is able to reverse alpha1A dysregulation, nor disturbed protein aggregation, transport and localization in this disease. The drugs gabapentin and pregabalin interact with the alpha2delta subunit of the P/Q-type VDCCs. Gabapentin and pregabalin slow the rate of inactivation in recombinant P/Q-type VDCCs, expressed in Xenopus oocytes. These drugs improve ataxia in cases of CCA, olivopontocerebellar atrophy and ataxia-telangiectasia. On the basis of the neuropathological identity of SCA 6 with CCA, and given the capacity of gabapentin and pregabalin to decrease P/Q-type VDCCs inactivation, in this paper the authors put forward the hypothesis that the administration of gabapentin and pregabalin might prove beneficial in SCA 6 as the ataxia caused by this disease would be expected to improve. The authors hope that researchers working with this illness will be inspired and encouraged to undertake the appropriate clinical and experimental work.

17035141|t|Neural tube defects and folate pathway genes: family-based association tests of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions.
17035141|a|BACKGROUND: Folate metabolism pathway genes have been examined for association with neural tube defects (NTDs) because folic acid supplementation reduces the risk of this debilitating birth defect. Most studies addressed these genes individually, often with different populations providing conflicting results. OBJECTIVES: Our study evaluates several folate pathway genes for association with human NTDs, incorporating an environmental cofactor: maternal folate supplementation. METHODS: In 304 Caucasian American NTD families with myelomeningocele or anencephaly, we examined 28 polymorphisms in 11 genes: folate receptor 1, folate receptor 2, solute carrier family 19 member 1, transcobalamin II, methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1, serine hydroxymethyl-transferase 1, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homo-cysteine methyltransferase, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase reductase, betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT), and cystathionine-beta-synthase. RESULTS: Only single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in BHMT were significantly associated in the overall data set; this significance was strongest when mothers took folate-containing nutritional supplements before conception. The BHMT SNP rs3733890 was more significant when the data were stratified by preferential transmission of the MTHFR rs1801133 thermolabile T allele from parent to offspring. Other SNPs in folate pathway genes were marginally significant in some analyses when stratified by maternal supplementation, MTHFR, or BHMT allele transmission. CONCLUSIONS: BHMT rs3733890 is significantly associated in our data set, whereas MTHFR rs1801133 is not a major risk factor. Further investigation of folate and methionine cycle genes will require extensive SNP genotyping and/or resequencing to identify novel variants, inclusion of environmental factors, and investigation of gene-gene interactions in large data sets.

17089011|t|DNA topoisomerase IIalpha (TOP2A) inhibitors up-regulate fatty acid synthase gene expression in SK-Br3 breast cancer cells: in vitro evidence for a 'functional amplicon' involving FAS, Her-2/neu and TOP2A genes.
17089011|a|Fatty acid synthase (FAS), the key metabolic multi-enzyme that is responsible for the terminal catalytic step in the de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, plays an active role in the development, maintenance, and enhancement of the malignant phenotype in a subset of breast carcinomas. We recently described that a molecular bi-directional cross-talk between FAS and the Her-2/neu (erbB-2) oncogene is taking place at the level of transcription, translation, and activity in breast cancer cells. Because Her-2/neu has been linked with altered sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs, we envisioned that FAS gene expression may represent a novel predictive molecular factor for breast cancer response to chemotherapy in a Her-2/neu-related manner. We herein evaluated whether chemotherapy-induced cell damage acts in an epigenetic fashion by inducing changes in the transcriptional activation of FAS gene in breast cancer cells. To evaluate this option, FAS- and Her-2/neu-overexpressing SK-Br3 breast cancer cells were transiently transfected with a FAS promoter-reporter construct (FAS-Luciferase) harboring all the elements necessary for high level expression in cancer cells. SK-Br3 cells cultured in the presence of topoisomerase IIalpha (TOP2A) inhibitors doxorubicin and etopoxide (VP-16) demonstrated a 2- to 3-fold increase in FAS promoter activity when compared with control cells growing in drug-free culture conditions. We failed to observe any significant activation of FAS promoter following exposure to the anti-metabolite 5-fluorouracil, the alkylating drug cisplatin, or the microtubule interfering-agents paclitaxel and vincristine. Moreover, the up-regulatory effects of TOP2A inhibitors on the transcriptional activation of FAS gene expression were not significantly decreased when the FAS promoter was damaged at the sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-binding site. Considering that FAS inhibition produces profound inhibition of DNA replication and S-phase progression in cancer cells, we finally asked whether a cross-talk between TOP2A and FAS could exhibit a Her-2/neu-related bi-directional nature. TOP2A protein levels were decreased during treatment with the anti-Her-2/neu antibody trastuzumab while, concomitantly, FAS promoter activity and FAS protein expression were significantly reduced. Of note, when the expression levels of TOP2A protein were analyzed following exposure of SK-Br3 cells to increasing concentrations of the novel slow-binding FAS inhibitor C75, a dose-dependent reduction in TOP2A expression was observed. Although FAS gene is not physically located in the Her-2/neu-TOP2A amplicon, our present findings strongly suggest that a tight functional association between FAS, Her-2/neu and TOP2A genes is taking place in a subset of breast carcinoma cells.

17125913|t|Cadmium induces mitogenic signaling in breast cancer cell by an ERalpha-dependent mechanism.
17125913|a|Breast cancer (BC) is linked to estrogen exposure. Estradiol (E2) stimulates BC cells proliferation by binding the estrogen receptor (ER). Hormone-related cancers have been linked to estrogenic environmental contaminants. Cadmium (Cd) a toxic pollutant, acts as estrogens in BC cells. Purpose of our study was to evaluate whether Cd regulates MCF-7 cell proliferation by activating ERK1/2, Akt and PDGFRalpha kinases. Cd increased cell proliferation and the ER-antagonist ICI 182,780 blunted it. To characterize an ER-dependent mechanism, ERalpha/beta expression was evaluated. Cd decreased ERalpha expression, but not ERbeta. Cd also increased ERK1/2, Akt and PDGFRalpha phosphorylation while ICI blocked it. Since stimulation of phosphorylation was slower than expected, c-fos and c-jun proto-oncogenes, and PDGFA were analyzed. Cd rapidly increased c-jun, c-fos and PDGFA expression. Cells were also co-incubated with the Cd and specific kinases inhibitors, which blocked the Cd-stimulated proliferation. In conclusion, our results indicate that Cd increases BC cell proliferation in vitro by stimulating Akt, ERK1/2 and PDGFRalpha kinases activity likely by activating c-fos, c-jun and PDGFA by an ERalpha-dependent mechanism.

17155857|t|Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors as a novel approach for the treatment of respiratory disease: cilomilast.
17155857|a|Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) is an important cAMP-metabolising enzyme in immune and inflammatory cells, airway smooth muscle and pulmonary nerves. The phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) enzyme plays a significant role in modulating the activity of cAMP, an important second messenger that mediates the relaxation of airway smooth muscle and suppresses inflammatory cell function, thereby attenuating the inflammatory response. Selective inhibitors of this enzyme show a broad spectrum of activity in animal models of COPD and asthma. These drugs block the hydrolysis of cAMP via inhibition of PDE4 and are attractive candidates for novel anti-inflammatory drugs. At present, two second-generation PDE4 inhibitors for the treatment of COPD and asthma patients are being tested in clinical Phase III trials. The most advanced compound is the orally active, selective PDE4 inhibitor cilomilast (Ariflo, SB-207499, cis-4-cyano-4-[3-cyclopentyloxy-4-methoxyphenyl]-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid; GlaxoSmithKline). Cilomilast shows high selectivity for cAMP-specific PDE4, an isoenzyme that predominates in pro-inflammatory and immune cells and that is 10-fold more selective for PDE4D than for PDE4A, -B or -C. In vitro, cilomilast suppresses the activity of several pro-inflammatory and immune cells that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma and COPD. Moreover, it is highly active in animal models of these diseases. Cilomilast has been shown to exert potent anti-inflammatory effects both in vitro and in vivo. It is orally active and may be effective in the treatment of asthma and COPD; however, complete assessment of the therapeutic value of this novel compound class must await the outcome of longer-term clinical trials. This review presents a summary of the preclinical and clinical profile of cilomilast in patients with COPD.

17205056|t|Antitumor activity of sorafenib in FLT3-driven leukemic cells.
17205056|a|Activating internal tandem duplication (ITD) insertions in the juxtamembrane domain of the FLT3 tyrosine kinase are found in about one fourth of patients with acute myeloid leukemia and have been shown to be an independent negative prognostic factor for survival. We show that sorafenib (BAY 43-9006, Nexavar) potently inhibits FLT3 enzymatic and signaling activities. In HEK293 cells stably transfected with FLT3-WT or FLT3-ITD, sorafenib blocked basal and ligand dependent FLT3-mediated tyrosine autophosphorylation as well as extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 and Stat5 phosphorylation. In leukemia cell lines MV4-11 and EOL-1, sorafenib treatment resulted in decreased cell proliferation and inhibition of FLT3 signaling. The growth of the FLT3-independent RS4-11 cell line was only weakly inhibited by sorafenib. Cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis were observed upon treatment with sorafenib in MV4-11 and EOL-1 cells. The antitumor efficacy of sorafenib was evaluated against the MV4-11 leukemia grown subcutaneously in NCr nu/nu mice. Doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg administered orally for 14 days resulted in six and nine out of 10 animals with complete responses, respectively. The demonstration that sorafenib exhibits potent target inhibition and efficacy in FLT3-driven models suggests that this compound may have a therapeutic benefit for patients with FLT3-driven leukemias.

17229632|t|The ability of sorafenib to inhibit oncogenic PDGFRbeta and FLT3 mutants and overcome resistance to other small molecule inhibitors.
17229632|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Activated tyrosine kinases are implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic and acute leukemia, and represent attractive targets for therapy. Sorafenib (BAY43-9006, Nexavar) is a small molecule B-RAF inhibitor that is used for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma, and has been shown to have activity against receptor tyrosine kinases from the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) families. We investigated the efficacy of sorafenib at inhibiting mutants of the receptor tyrosine kinases PDGFRbeta, KIT, and FLT3, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies. DESIGN AND METHODS: We tested the effect of sorafenib on the proliferation of hematopoietic cells transformed by ETV6-PDGFRbeta, FLT3 with an internal tandem duplication or D835Y point mutation, and the KIT(D816V) mutant. The direct effect of sorafenib on the activity of these kinases and their downstream signaling was tested using phospho-specific antibodies. RESULTS: We show that sorafenib is a potent inhibitor of ETV6-PDGFRbeta and FLT3 mutants, including some of the mutants that confer resistance to PKC412 and other FLT3 inhibitors. Sorafenib induced a cell cycle block and apoptosis in the acute myeloid leukemia cell lines MV4-11 and MOLM-13, both expressing FLT3 with an internal tandem duplication, whereas no effect was observed on four other acute myeloid leukemia cell lines. The imatinib-resistant KIT(D816V) mutant, associated with systemic mastocytosis, was found to be resistant to sorafenib. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These results warrant further clinical studies of sorafenib for the treatment of myeloid malignancies expressing activated forms of PDGFRbeta and FLT3.

17273750|t|Cimetidine induces apoptosis of human salivary gland tumor cells.
17273750|a|It has been reported that cimetidine, a histamine type-2 receptor (H2R) antagonist, inhibits the growth of glandular tumors such as colorectal cancer. However, its effects against salivary gland tumors are still unknown. We demonstrated previously that human salivary gland tumor (HSG) cells spontaneously express the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and also that HSG cell proliferation could be controlled via a homophilic (NCAM-NCAM) binding mechanism and that NCAM may be associated with perineural invasion by malignant salivary gland tumors. In the present study, we investigated the effects of cimetidine via the expression of NCAM on tumor growth and perineural/neural invasion in salivary gland tumor cells. Expression of both NCAM mRNA and protein was found to decrease in a dose-dependent manner upon treatment with cimetidine for 24 h. The MTT assay and confocal laser microscopy clearly showed that HSG cells underwent apoptosis after treatment with cimetidine. Activation of caspases 3, 7, 8 and 9 was observed in HSG cells after cimetidine treatment, thus confirming that the apoptosis was induced by the activated caspases. Apaf-1 activity was also detected in HSG cells in a dose-dependent manner after treatment with cimetidine. We also found that the cimetidine-mediated down-regulation of NCAM expression in HSG cells did not occur via blocking of the histamine receptor, even though H2R expression was observed on HSG cells, as two other H2R antagonists, famotidine and ranitidine, did not show similar effects. We demonstrated for the first time that cimetidine can induce significant apoptosis of salivary gland tumor cells, which express NCAM, at least in part by down-regulation of NCAM expression on the cells. These findings suggest that the growth, development and perineural/neural invasion of salivary gland tumor cells can be blocked by cimetidine administration through down-regulation of NCAM expression, as well as induction of apoptosis.

17390078|t|Gene expression signature of parathion-transformed human breast epithelial cells.
17390078|a|Environmental substances seem to be involved in the etiology of breast cancers. Many studies have found an association between human cancer and exposure to agricultural pesticides such as the organophosphorous pesticides. Parathion is a cholinesterase inhibitor that induces the hydrolysis of body choline esters, including acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses. The primary target of action in insects is the nervous system whereby pesticides inhibit the release of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase at the synaptic junction. Atropine is a parasympatholytic alkaloid used as an antidote to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of parathion and atropine on cell transformation of human breast epithelial cells in vitro. These studies showed that parathion alone was able to induce malignant transformation of an immortalized human breast epithelial cell line, MCF-10F as indicated by increased cell proliferation, anchorage independency and invasive capabilities. There was also an increase in c-kit, Trio, Rho-A, Rac-3, EGFR, Notch-4, Dvl-2, Ezrin, beta catenin and mutant p53 protein expression in the parathion-treated cells. However, atropine significantly inhibited this increase. In a human cell cycle array of 96 genes, 13 of them were altered by parathion treatment. Among the genes affected were the cyclins, such as cyclin D3, the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) such as CDK41 and the minichromosome maintenance deficient (MCM) MCM2 and MCM3. It is suggested that parathion influences human breast epithelial cell transformation and is an initiator factor in the transformation process in breast cancer.

17409426|t|Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs induce colorectal cancer cell apoptosis by suppressing 14-3-3epsilon.
17409426|a|To determine the role of 14-3-3 in colorectal cancer apoptosis induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), we evaluated the effects of sulindac on 14-3-3epsilon protein expression in colorectal cancer cells. Sulindac sulfide inhibited 14-3-3epsilon proteins in HT-29 and DLD-1 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Sulindac sulfone at 600 mumol/L inhibited 14-3-3epsilon protein expression in HT-29. Indomethacin and SC-236, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, exerted a similar effect as sulindac. Sulindac suppressed 14-3-3epsilon promoter activity. As 14-3-3epsilon promoter activation is mediated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARdelta), we determined the correlation between 14-3-3epsilon inhibition and PPARdelta suppression by NSAIDs. Sulindac sulfide inhibited PPARdelta protein expression and PPARdelta transcriptional activity. Overexpression of PPARdelta by adenoviral transfer rescued 14-3-3epsilon proteins from elimination by sulindac or indomethacin. NSAID-induced 14-3-3epsilon suppression was associated with reduced cytosolic Bad with elevation of mitochondrial Bad and increase in apoptosis which was rescued by Ad-PPARdelta transduction. Stable expression of 14-3-3epsilon in HT-29 significantly protected cells from apoptosis. Our findings shed light on a novel mechanism by which NSAIDs induce colorectal cancer apoptosis via the PPARdelta/14-3-3epsilon transcriptional pathway. These results suggest that 14-3-3epsilon is a target for the prevention and therapy of colorectal cancer.

17498959|t|Sulfated glucosamine inhibits MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions in human fibrosarcoma cells.
17498959|a|In the present study, sulfated glucosamine (SGlc) that has been reported to relieve joint pain and inflammation in many arthritis patients was studied for its inhibitory effects on MMP-2 and MMP-9 in human fibrosarcoma cells. Expression and activity of above MMPs studied using gelatin zymography suggested SGlc as a potent MMP inhibitor. Further, transfection of promoter genes of MMPs and their transcription factors clearly exhibited that inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was due to down-regulation of transcription factor, NF-kappaB. However expression of activator protein-1 (AP-1), another important transcription factor of MMPs, was not affected by SGlc treatment. In addition, protein expression results of Western blot analysis were also in agreement with the results of gene transfection experiments. Moreover, down-regulation of NF-kappaB resulted in production of low levels of both NF-kappaB p50 and p65 proteins and directly affected activation process of MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions. Since MMPs involve in joint inflammation, it can be presumed that inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9 can be one of the mechanisms of SGlc to be an effective drug in relieving the symptoms of osteoarthritis.

17567713|t|Artificial sweeteners and salts producing a metallic taste sensation activate TRPV1 receptors.
17567713|a|Throughout the world many people use artificial sweeteners (AS) for the purpose of reducing caloric intake. The most prominently used of these molecules include saccharin, aspartame (Nutrasweet), acesulfame-K, and cyclamate. Despite the caloric advantage they provide, one key concern in their use is their aversive aftertaste that has been characterized on a sensory level as bitter and/or metallic. Recently, it has been shown that the activation of particular T2R bitter taste receptors is partially involved with the bitter aftertaste sensation of saccharin and acesulfame-K. To more fully understand the biology behind these phenomena we have addressed the question of whether AS could stimulate transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) receptors, as these receptors are activated by a large range of structurally different chemicals. Moreover, TRPV1 receptors and/or their variants are found in taste receptor cells and in nerve terminals throughout the oral cavity. Hence, TRPV1 activation could be involved in the AS aftertaste or even contribute to the poorly understood metallic taste sensation. Using Ca(2+) imaging on TRPV1 receptors heterologously expressed in the human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and on dissociated primary sensory neurons, we find that in both systems, AS activate TRPV1 receptors, and, moreover, they sensitize these channels to acid and heat. We also found that TRPV1 receptors are activated by CuSO(4), ZnSO(4), and FeSO(4), three salts known to produce a metallic taste sensation. In summary, our results identify a novel group of compounds that activate TRPV1 and, consequently, provide a molecular mechanism that may account for off tastes of sweeteners and metallic tasting salts.

17604186|t|Neuroprotective effect of nimesulide, a preferential COX-2 inhibitor, against pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced chemical kindling and associated biochemical parameters in mice.
17604186|a|Brain cyclooxygenases (COX), the rate-limiting enzyme in prostaglandin synthesis, is rapidly and transiently induced by convulsions in hippocampal and cortical neurons. Previous studies have explored the protective effect of naproxen (non-selective COX-inhibitor) or rofecoxib (selective COX-2 inhibitor) against chemical kindling in mice. With this background, the present study was designed to explore the possible effect of nimesulide (a preferential COX-2 inhibitor) against pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced kindling epilepsy in mice. To induce kindling, PTZ was injected in a subconvulsive dose (40 mg/kg, i.p.) every other day for 15 days. Nimesulide (2.5 or 5 mg/kg, p.o.) was administered each day 45 min before either PTZ or vehicle challenge. The intensity of kindling was assessed immediately after PTZ administration according to a prevalidated scoring scale. On 16th day i.e. 24 h after the last dose of PTZ, animals were sacrificed and various biochemical parameters were assessed in the whole brain. Compared with normal control group, PTZ-kindled mice had significantly higher levels of malondialdehyde, nitrite, myeloperoxidase but had lower levels of reduced glutathione in the whole brain homogenate. Chronic treatment with nimesulide (2.5 or 5 mg/kg, p.o.) for 15 days showed significant decrease in kindling score and could play a role in controlling the accompanying biochemical alterations due to PTZ. These results suggested that nimesulide, a preferential COX-2 inhibitor offered neuroprotection against PTZ-induced kindling in mice.

17611697|t|RARalpha is a regulatory factor for Am-80-induced cell growth inhibition of hematologic malignant cells.
17611697|a|Retinoids are used for treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Am-80, Tamibarotene, binds to retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) more specifically than all-trans retinoic acid. We studied the tumor cell suppressive effects of Am-80, with respect to cytotoxicity and growth inhibition using eight myeloid and lymphoid malignant cells in culture (HL-60, HL-60R, K-562, Kasumi-1, MEG01, Raji, U266B1, and U937). The effects of Am-80 were examined during 9 days of incubation with 10(-7)-10(-5) M of Am-80 in culture medium, which was changed every 3 days. HL-60 were the only cells sensitive to Am-80-induced cytotoxicity; the latter reached more than 95% after 9 days of incubation, and death was primarily through apoptosis. The total mass of RARalpha in HL-60 was significantly greater (p&lt;0.006) than in ATRA-resistant HL-60 (HL-60R) as well as all of other cells tested. However, in all cells excluding HL-60, Am-80 induced time- and dose-dependent cell growth inhibition without noticeable cytotoxicity. TGF-beta2 was released into the media containing cells incubated with Am-80 for 3 days. A dose-dependent increment of phosphorylation of Smad-2 was also detected. The relative amount of secreted TGF-beta2 correlated with the growth inhibition rates in all cells tested excluding HL-60, and with the total mass of RARalpha in the cells (p=0.0137). Our results indicate that Am-80-induced cell-type non-specific growth inhibition is mediated by TGF-beta2, where the total mass of RARalpha could be an important regulatory factor in hematologic malignant cells.

18079279|t|Modulation of receptor phosphorylation contributes to activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha by dehydroepiandrosterone and other peroxisome proliferators.
18079279|a|Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a C19 human adrenal steroid, activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) in vivo but does not ligand-activate PPARalpha in transient transfection experiments. We demonstrate that DHEA regulates PPARalpha action by altering both the levels and phosphorylation status of the receptor. Human hepatoma cells (HepG2) were transiently transfected with the expression plasmid encoding PPARalpha and a plasmid containing two copies of fatty acyl coenzyme oxidase (FACO) peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor responsive element consensus oligonucleotide in a luciferase reporter gene. Nafenopin treatment increased reporter gene activity in this system, whereas DHEA treatment did not. Okadaic acid significantly decreased nafenopin-induced reporter activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Okadaic acid treatment of primary rat hepatocytes decreased both DHEA- and nafenopin-induced FACO activity in primary rat hepatocytes. DHEA induced both PPARalpha mRNA and protein levels, as well as PP2A message in primary rat hepatocytes. Western blot analysis showed that the serines at positions 12 and 21 were rapidly dephosphorylated upon treatment with DHEA and nafenopin. Results using specific protein phosphatase inhibitors suggested that protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is responsible for DHEA action, and protein phosphatase 1 might be involved in nafenopin induction. Mutation of serines at position 6, 12, and 21 to an uncharged alanine residue significantly increased transcriptional activity, whereas mutation to negative charged aspartate residues (mimicking receptor phosphorylation) decreased transcriptional activity. DHEA action involves induction of PPARalpha mRNA and protein levels as well as increased PPARalpha transcriptional activity through decreasing receptor phosphorylation at serines in the AF1 region.

19023039|t|Pharmacological characterization of pannexin-1 currents expressed in mammalian cells.
19023039|a|Pannexin (Panx) 1 is a widely expressed protein that shares structural, but not amino acid, homology with gap junction proteins, the connexins. Panx1 does not form gap junctions in mammalian cells, but it may function as a plasma membrane hemichannel. Little is known of the pharmacological properties of panx1 expression in mammalian cells. Here, we identify three variants in the human PANX1 gene. We expressed these variants and mouse Panx1 in mammalian cells and compared Panx1-induced currents. All human Panx1 variants and the mouse Panx1 showed identical protein expression levels, localization patterns, and functional properties, although the frequency of functional expression was species-dependent. Panx1 currents were independent of changes in extracellular or intracellular calcium or phospholipase C transduction. We found compounds that inhibited Panx1 currents with a rank order of potency: carbenoxolone &gt; disodium 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (DIDS) approximately disodium 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanato-stilben-2,2'-disulfonate approximately 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid &gt; indanyloxyacetic acid 94 &gt;&gt; probenecid &gt;&gt; flufenamic acid = niflumic acid. Triphosphate nucleotides (ATP, GTP, and UTP) rapidly and reversibly inhibited Panx1 currents via mechanism(s) independent of purine receptors. When Panx1 was coexpressed with purinergic P2X(7) receptor (P2X(7)R), DIDS was found to act as a P2X(7)R antagonist to inhibit ATP-evoked currents, but none of the other compounds inhibited P2X(7)R currents. This is the first detailed pharmacological characterization of Panx1-mediated currents in mammalian cells and sheds new, although contradictory, light on the hypothesis that Panx1 acts as a hemichannel to allow passage of large molecules in response to P2X(7)R activation.

19213873|t|Pannexin 1 contributes to ATP release in airway epithelia.
19213873|a|ATP is a paracrine regulator of critical airway epithelial cell functions, but the mechanism of its release is poorly understood. Pannexin (Panx) proteins, related to invertebrate innexins, form channels (called pannexons) that are able to release ATP from several cell types. Thus, ATP release via pannexons was examined in airway epithelial cells. Quantitative RT-PCR showed Panx1 expression in normal human airway epithelial cells during redifferentiation at the air-liquid interface (ALI), at a level comparable to that of alveolar macrophages; Panx3 was not expressed. Immunohistochemistry showed Panx1 expression at the apical pole of airway epithelia. ALI cultures exposed to hypotonic stress released ATP to an estimated maximum of 255 (+/-64) nM within 1 minute after challenge (n = 6 cultures from three different lungs) or to approximately 1.5 (+/-0.4) microM, recalculated to a normal airway surface liquid volume. Using date- and culture-matched cells (each n &gt; or = 16 from 4 different lungs), the pannexon inhibitors carbenoxolone (10 microM) and probenecid (1 mM), but not the connexon inhibitor flufenamic acid (100 microM), inhibited ATP release by approximately 60%. The drugs affected Panx1 currents in Xenopus oocytes expressing exogenous Panx1 correspondingly. In addition, suppression of Panx1 expression using lentivirus-mediated production of shRNA in differentiated airway epithelial cells inhibited ATP release upon hypotonic stress by approximately 60% as well. These data not only show that Panx1 is expressed apically in differentiated airway epithelial cells but also that it contributes to ATP release in these cells.

20448797|t|New standards in hypertension and cardiovascular risk management: focus on telmisartan.
20448797|a|Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system is an important approach in managing high blood pressure, and has increasingly been shown to affect cardiovascular disease processes mediated by angiotensin II throughout the cardiovascular and renal continua. Telmisartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) displaying unique pharmacologic properties, including a longer half life than any other ARB, that result in large and sustained reductions of blood pressure. In patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, telmisartan has proved superior to other antihypertensive agents (valsartan, losartan, ramipril, perindopril, and atenolol) in controlling blood pressure particularly towards the end of the dosing interval. There is also clinical evidence that telmisartan reduces left ventricular hypertrophy, reduces arterial stiffness and the recurrence of atrial fibrillation, and confers renoprotection. The ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) study has demonstrated that telmisartan has similar cardiovascular protective effects to ramipril in a large, high-risk patient population but was better tolerated. The powerful and sustained blood pressure control apparent in clinical trials, together with cardiovascular protection and tolerability demonstrated in ONTARGET means that telmisartan may be a preferred option for patients with hypertension.

21058326|t|Effects of the histamine H1 antagonist chlorcyclizine on rat fetal palate development.
21058326|a|BACKGROUND: The effects of histamine H1 antagonist chlorcyclizine on rat palate development were characterized following in utero exposure. METHODS: To identify the optimum dose for inducing cleft palate, pregnant rats were administered 30, 60, or 90 mg/kg chlorcyclizine on Gestation Days 11 to 14. Fetal palate gene expression was also assessed after 90 mg/kg chlorcyclizine at 8, 15 and 30 hours post-dose on Gestation Day 14 using microarray and qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Rats in the 60- and 90-mg/kg groups exhibited adverse clinical signs and body weight loss. Rats in the 90-mg/kg group also demonstrated increases in late resorptions and decreases in fetal weight. Effects in the low-dose group were limited to decreases in body weight gain. Fetal assessment on Gestation Day 21 revealed that findings were limited to the 60- and 90-mg/kg groups, and included cleft palate (80% of litters for both groups), high arched palate, small nose, micrognathia, high domed head, digits shortened/absent and small limb. The fetal incidence of cleft palate was higher at 90 mg/kg, thus this dose was selected to assess palate gene expression. The altered genes associated with chlorcyclizine-induced cleft palate included Wnt5a, Bmp2, Bmp4, Fgf10, Fgfr2, Msx1, and Insig1 but the magnitude of the change was relatively small (1.5- to 2-fold). CONCLUSIONS: Expression of several genes involved in palate, limb and digit development was altered in the fetal palate following in utero exposure to chlorcyclizine. The subtle perturbation and interplay of these genes may have profound effects on the dynamics of fetal palate development.

21308351|t|Involvement of riboflavin kinase expression in cellular sensitivity against cisplatin.
21308351|a|Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) is an essential coenzyme for glutathione reductase (GR) which catalyzes the reduction of oxidized glutathione to regenerate the reduced form involved in protection against oxidative stress. Riboflavin kinase (RFK) also known as flavokinase is involved in the first step of bioactivation of riboflavin (RF) to form flavin mononucleotide (FMN) which can be subsequently converted to FAD in an ATP-dependent reaction catalyzed by FAD synthetase (FADS). We investigated the involvement of RFK in cisplatin resistance using human prostate cancer PC3 cells. RFK overexpression renders cells resistant not only to cisplatin but also to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and diamide. Furthermore, knockdown of RFK expression induced apoptosis. We demonstrated that overexpression of RFK increased the levels of FAD, FMN and total glutathione and the expression of GR and glutathione S-transferase-pi (GSTpi). RFK expression is up-regulated in cisplatin-resistant P/CDP6 cells in addition to FAD, total glutathione level, GR and GSTpi. Knockdown of RFK expression also sensitized both PC3 and P/CDP6 cells to cisplatin. Moreover, cellular levels of RFK expression correlate well with Gleason score, known as a good indicator of patient prognosis. The present study suggests that RFK expression is involved not only in cellular protection from oxidative stress but also in malignant progression of prostate cancer.

Compound 5m displayed antagonistic properties at 5-HT(3A) and 5-HT(7) receptors, partial agonist properties at 5-HT(1B) receptors, agonistic properties at 5-HT(1A) receptors, and potent inhibition of SERT. In conscious rats, 5m significantly increased extracellular 5-HT levels in the brain after acute and 3 days of treatment. Following the 3-day treatment (5 or 10 (mg/kg)/day) SERT occupancies were only 43% and 57%, respectively. These characteristics indicate that 5m is a novel multimodal serotonergic compound, and 5m is currently in clinical development for major depressive disorder.

22370636|t|Conditional activation of Pik3ca(H1047R) in a knock-in mouse model promotes mammary tumorigenesis and emergence of mutations.
22370636|a|Oncogenic mutations in PIK3CA, which encodes the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) catalytic subunit p110alpha, occur in ~25% of human breast cancers. In this study, we report the development of a knock-in mouse model for breast cancer where the endogenous Pik3ca allele was modified to allow tissue-specific conditional expression of a frequently found Pik3ca(H1047R) (Pik3ca(e20H1047R)) mutant allele. We found that activation of the latent Pik3ca(H1047R) allele resulted in breast tumors with multiple histological types. Whole-exome analysis of the Pik3ca(H1047R)-driven mammary tumors identified multiple mutations, including Trp53 mutations that appeared spontaneously during the development of adenocarinoma and spindle cell tumors. Further, we used this model to test the efficacy of GDC-0941, a PI3K inhibitor, in clinical development, and showed that the tumors respond to PI3K inhibition.

22898132|t|Assessment of developmental delay in the zebrafish embryo teratogenicity assay.
22898132|a|In this study we analyzed some aspects of the assessment of developmental delay in the zebrafish embryotoxicity/teratogenicity test and explored the suitability of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity as a biochemical marker and as a higher throughput alternative to morphological endpoints such as head-trunk angle, tail length and morphological score. Embryos were exposed from 4 to 52 h post-fertilization (hpf) to a selection of known embryotoxic/teratogen compounds (valproic acid, retinoic acid, caffeine, sodium salicylate, glucose, hydroxyurea, methoxyacetic acid, boric acid and paraoxon-methyl) over a concentration range. They were evaluated for AChE activity, head-trunk angle, tail length and several qualitative parameters integrated in a morphological score. In general, the different patterns of the concentration-response curves allowed distinguishing between chemicals that produced growth retardation (valproic and methoxyacetic acid) and chemicals that produced non-growth-delay related malformations. An acceptable correlation between the morphological score, AChE activity and head-trunk angle as markers of developmental delay was observed, being AChE activity particularly sensitive to detect delay in the absence of malformations.

22898212|t|Cresyl saligenin phosphate makes multiple adducts on free histidine, but does not form an adduct on histidine 438 of human butyrylcholinesterase.
22898212|a|Cresyl saligenin phosphate (CBDP) is a suspected causative agent of "aerotoxic syndrome", affecting pilots, crew members and passengers. CBDP is produced in vivo from ortho-containing isomers of tricresyl phosphate (TCP), a component of jet engine lubricants and hydraulic fluids. CBDP irreversibly inhibits butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in human plasma by forming adducts on the active site serine (Ser-198). Inhibited BChE undergoes aging to release saligenin and o-cresol. The active site histidine (His-438) was hypothesized to abstract o-hydroxybenzyl moiety from the initial adduct on Ser-198. Our goal was to test this hypothesis. Mass spectral analysis of CBDP-inhibited BChE digested with Glu-C showed an o-hydroxybenzyl adduct (+106 amu) on lysine 499, a residue far from the active site, but not on His-438. Nevertheless, the nitrogen of the imidazole ring of free L-histidine formed a variety of adducts upon reaction with CBDP, including the o-hydroxybenzyl adduct, suggesting that histidine-CBDP adducts may form on other proteins.

22944069|t|Lithium treatment induces proteasomal degradation of over-expressed acetylcholinesterase (AChE-S) and inhibit GSK3beta.
22944069|a|Lithium is one of the most widely used mood-stabilizing agents for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Lithium is also a potent inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) activity, which is linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD). In experiments with cultured HEK293T cells, we show here that GSK3beta stabilizes synaptic acetylcholinesterase (AChE-S), a critical component of AD development. Cells treated with lithium exhibited rapid proteasomal degradation of AChE-S. Furthermore treatment of the cells with MG132, an inhibitor of the 26S proteasome, prevented the destabilizing effect of lithium on AChE-S. Taken together, these findings suggest that regulation of AChE-S protein stability may be an important biological target of lithium therapy.

22956632|t|Toxicity profile of small-molecule IAP antagonist GDC-0152 is linked to TNF-alpha pharmacology.
22956632|a|Inhibitor-of-apoptosis (IAP) proteins suppress apoptosis and are overexpressed in a variety of cancers. Small-molecule IAP antagonists are currently being tested in clinical trials as novel cancer therapeutics. GDC-0152 is a small-molecule drug that triggers tumor cell apoptosis by selectively antagonizing IAPs. GDC-0152 induces NF-kappaB transcriptional activity leading to expression of several chemokines and cytokines, of which tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is the most important for single-agent tumor activity. TNF-alpha is a pleiotropic cytokine that drives a variety of cellular responses, comprising inflammation, proliferation, and cell survival or death depending on the cellular context. As malignant and normal cells produce TNF-alpha upon IAP antagonism, increased TNF-alpha could drive both efficacy and toxicity. The toxicity profile of GDC-0152 in dogs and rats was characterized after iv dose administration once every 2 weeks for four doses. Findings in both species consisted of a dose-related, acute, systemic inflammatory response, and hepatic injury. Laboratory findings included elevated plasma cytokines, an inflammatory leukogram, and increased liver transaminases with histopathological findings of inflammatory infiltrates and apoptosis/necrosis in multiple tissues; a toxicology profile consistent with TNF-alpha-mediated toxicity. Dogs exhibited more severe findings than rats, and humans did not exhibit these findings, at comparable exposures across species. Furthermore, elevations in blood neutrophil count, serum monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and other markers of inflammation corresponded to GDC-0152 exposure and toxicity and thus may have utility as safety biomarkers.

22975155|t|Mechanism of interaction of novel uncharged, centrally active reactivators with OP-hAChE conjugates.
22975155|a|A library of more than 200 novel uncharged oxime reactivators was used to select and refine lead reactivators of human acetylcholinesterase (hAChE) covalently conjugated with sarin, cyclosarin, VX, paraoxon and tabun. N-substituted 2-hydroxyiminoacetamido alkylamines were identified as best reactivators and reactivation kinetics of the lead oximes, RS41A and RS194B, were analyzed in detail. Compared to reference pyridinium reactivators, 2PAM and MMB4, molecular recognition of RS41A reflected in its Kox constant was compromised by an order of magnitude on average for different OP-hAChE conjugates, without significant differences in the first order maximal phosphorylation rate constant k(2). Systematic structural modifications of the RS41A lead resulted in several-fold improvement with reactivator, RS194B. Kinetic analysis indicated K(ox) reduction for RS194B as the main kinetic constant leading to efficient reactivation. Subtle structural modifications of RS194B were used to identify essential determinants for efficient reactivation. Computational molecular modeling of RS41A and RS194B interactions with VX inhibited hAChE, bound reversibly in Michaelis type complex and covalently in the pentacoordinate reaction intermediate suggests that the faster reactivation reaction is a consequence of a tighter RS194B interactions with hAChE peripheral site (PAS) residues, in particular with D74, resulting in lower interaction energies for formation of both the binding and reactivation states. Desirable in vitro reactivation properties of RS194B, when coupled with its in vivo pharmacokinetics and disposition in the body, reveal the potential of this oxime design as promising centrally and peripherally active antidotes for OP toxicity.

22982773|t|A common mechanism for resistance to oxime reactivation of acetylcholinesterase inhibited by organophosphorus compounds.
22982773|a|Administration of oxime therapy is currently the standard approach used to reverse the acute toxicity of organophosphorus (OP) compounds, which is usually attributed to OP inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Rate constants for reactivation of OP-inhibited AChE by even the best oximes, such as HI-6 and obidoxime, can vary &gt;100-fold between OP-AChE conjugates that are easily reactivated and those that are difficult to reactivate. To gain a better understanding of this oxime specificity problem for future design of improved reactivators, we conducted a QSAR analysis for oxime reactivation of AChE inhibited by OP agents and their analogues. Our objective was to identify common mechanism(s) among OP-AChE conjugates of phosphates, phosphonates and phosphoramidates that result in resistance to oxime reactivation. Our evaluation of oxime reactivation of AChE inhibited by a sarin analogue, O-methyl isopropylphosphonofluoridate, or a cyclosarin analogue, O-methyl cyclohexylphosphonofluoridate, indicated that AChE inhibited by these analogues was at least 70-fold more difficult to reactivate than AChE inhibited by sarin or cyclosarin. In addition, AChE inhibited by an analogue of tabun (i.e., O-ethyl isopropylphosphonofluoridate) was nearly as resistant to reactivation as tabun-inhibited AChE. QSAR analysis of oxime reactivation of AChE inhibited by these OP compounds and others suggested that the presence of both a large substituent (i.e., &gt;= the size of dimethylamine) and an alkoxy substituent in the structure of OP compounds is the common feature that results in resistance to oxime reactivation of OP-AChE conjugates whether the OP is a phosphate, phosphonate or phosphoramidate.

22983118|t|The neurotoxicity of hallucinogenic amphetamines in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons.
22983118|a|3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or "Ecstasy") and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine hydrochloride (DOI) are hallucinogenic amphetamines with addictive properties. The hippocampus is involved in learning and memory and seems particularly vulnerable to amphetamine's neurotoxicity. We evaluated the neurotoxicity of DOI and MDMA in primary neuronal cultures of hippocampus obtained from Wistar rat embryos (E-17 to E-19). Mature neurons after 10 days in culture were exposed for 24 or 48 h either to MDMA (100-800 muM) or DOI (10-100 muM). Both the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and the tetrazolium-based (MTT) assays revealed a concentration- and time-dependent neuronal death and mitochondrial dysfunction after exposure to both drugs. Both drugs promoted a significant increase in caspase-8 and caspase-3 activities. At concentrations that produced similar levels of neuronal death, DOI promoted a higher increase in the activity of both caspases than MDMA. In the mitochondrial fraction of neurons exposed 24h to DOI or MDMA, we found a significant increase in the 67 kDa band of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) by Western blot. Moreover, 24h exposure to DOI promoted an increase in cytochrome c in the cytoplasmatic fraction of neurons. Pre-treatment with an antibody raised against the 5-HT(2A)-receptor (an irreversible antagonist) greatly attenuated neuronal death promoted by 48 h exposure to DOI or MDMA. In conclusion, hallucinogenic amphetamines promoted programmed neuronal death involving both the mitochondria machinery and the extrinsic cell death key regulators. Death was dependent, at least in part, on the stimulation of the 5-HT(2A)-receptors.

22989705|t|Pioglitazone protects against cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity in rats and potentiates its anticancer activity against human renal adenocarcinoma cell lines.
22989705|a|Cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity is a serious problem that limits its use in cancer treatment. The present study aimed to investigate the renal protective capacity of pioglitazone to reduce the cisplatin- induced nephrotoxicity. The underlying suggested mechanism(s) and whether this nephroprotective effect (if any) interferes with the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin on cancer cells were also investigated. Pioglitazone, Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, BADGE, IP injected (Peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) antagonist), or their combination were administered to rats one hour before cisplatin injection. Moreover, their effects on the cell viability of human renal adenocarcinoma cell models (ACHN) were studied. The obtained results showed that pioglitazone improved the renal function, structural changes, renal malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) genes expression in cisplatin injected rats. It increased both renal reduced glutathione (GSH) content and PPAR-gamma gene expression. In contrast to the data obtained by prior administration of BADGE. Pioglitazone also potentiated the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin on human renal adenocarcinoma cells and this effect was abolished by BADGE co administration. In conclusion, these results suggested that pioglitazone protected against cisplatin- induced nephrotoxicity through its interaction with PPAR-gamma receptors and antioxidant effects. Furthermore, pioglitazone did not interfere but rather potentiated the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin on human renal adenocarcinoma cells.

22995584|t|Induction of apoptosis in human ovarian cancer cells by new anticancer compounds, epothilone A and B.
22995584|a|Epothilones are a new group of compounds with action mechanisms similar to taxanes. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of epothilone A (Epo A) and epothilone B (Epo B) on ovarian cancer cell line SKOV-3 with those of paclitaxel (PTX), a classic taxane. We evaluate glycoprotein P (P-gp) activity in the ovarian cancer cell line. Apoptotic and necrotic cell levels were measured by double staining with Hoechst 33258 and propidium iodide (PI) as well as Annexin V staining. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) in cells exposed to Epo A, Epo B and PTX were studied using specific fluorescence probes, DCFH(2)-DA (2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate) and JC-1 (5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolcarbocyanine). The cytotoxic activity of the drugs was determined by the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide) test. All probes were analyzed in both the presence and absence of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC). The results obtained demonstrated that the antiproliferative capacity of Epo A and Epo B in SKOV-3 cell line (measured as IC(50) after 72 h continuous treatment) was six and five times greater than that of PTX's respectively. Epothilones induced timecourse-dependent apoptosis and necrosis. Apoptotic and necrotic events were partially blocked by NAC, indicating ROS played a substantial role in epothilone-induced apoptosis. Cell death was also associated with a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, which was more pronounced after treatment with epothilones as compared to paclitaxel.

23000450|t|-116A and K BCHE gene variants associated with obesity and hypertriglyceridemia in adolescents from Southern Brazil.
23000450|a|Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) has been associated to body mass index (BMI), weight, cholesterol and triglyceride levels. -116A (rs1126680) and K (A539T, 1615A, rs1803274) BCHE gene variants had previously been associated to BChE activity, weight and BMI variance in adults. The present study examined -116A and K variants, BChE activity, anthropometric and biochemical variables associated with obesity in adolescents (120 obese and 150 non-obese from Curitiba, Brazil). Both -116A and K variants were found with significantly lower frequencies (p&lt;0.05) in obese adolescents when compared with non-obese adolescents and with the general population. Mean BChE activity (KU/L) was significantly higher in obese adolescents when compared with non-obese adolescents and with the general population. Analyzing only the obese adolescents, it was found that carriers of the -116A variant showed lower BChE activity and higher triglyceride levels than homozygotes for the usual allele. Indeed, obese carriers of the -116A variant had triglyceride levels considered high according to reference values for serum triglycerides in Brazilian adolescents. These results show: (1) a protective effect of -116A and K variants on juvenile obesity risk, suggesting a role for the BCHE gene on juvenile onset obesity different from that observed on adult onset obesity and (2) an association of the -116A variant with hypertriglyceridemia in obese adolescents probably because of its effect on lowering BChE activity and consequently diminishing the enzyme capability of maintaining homeostasis on lipid metabolism during the metabolic stress caused by obesity.

23007560|t|The influence of chronic fluorosis on mitochondrial dynamics morphology and distribution in cortical neurons of the rat brain.
23007560|a|The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of chronic fluorosis on the dynamics (including fusion and fission proteins), fragmentation, and distribution of mitochondria in the cortical neurons of the rat brain in an attempt to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying the brain damage associated with excess accumulation of fluoride. Sixty Sprague-Dawley rats were divided randomly into three groups of 20 each, that is, the untreated control group (drinking water naturally containing &lt;0.5 mg fluoride/l, NaF), the low-fluoride group (whose drinking water was supplemented with 10 mg fluoride/l) and the high-fluoride group (50 mg fluoride/l). After 6 months of exposure, the expression of mitofusin-1 (Mfn1), fission-1 (Fis1), and dynamin-related protein-1 (Drp1) at both the protein and mRNA levels were detected by Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and real-time PCR, respectively. Moreover, mitochondrial morphology and distribution in neurons were observed by transmission electron or fluorescence microscopy. In the cortices of the brains of rats with chronic fluorosis, the level of Mfn1 protein was clearly reduced, whereas the levels of Fis1 and Drp1 were elevated. The alternations of expression of the mRNAs encoding all three of these proteins were almost the same as the corresponding changes at the protein levels. The mitochondria were fragmented and the redistributed away from the axons of the cortical neurons. These findings indicate that chronic fluorosis induces abnormal mitochondrial dynamics, which might in turn result in a high level of oxidative stress.

23022069|t|Performance of urinary and gene expression biomarkers in detecting the nephrotoxic effects of melamine and cyanuric acid following diverse scenarios of co-exposure.
23022069|a|Although standard nephrotoxicity assessments primarily detect impaired renal function, KIM-1, clusterin, NGAL, osteopontin and TIMP-1 were recently identified biomarkers proposed to indicate earlier perturbations in renal integrity. The recent adulteration of infant and pet food with melamine (MEL) and structurally-related compounds revealed that co-ingestion of MEL and cyanuric acid (CYA) could form melamine-cyanurate crystals which obstruct renal tubules and induce acute renal failure. This study concurrently evaluated the ability of multiplexed urinary biomarker immunoassays and biomarker gene expression analysis to detect nephrotoxicity in F344 rats co-administered 60ppm each of MEL and CYA in feed or via gavage for 28days. The biomarkers were also evaluated for the ability to differentiate the effects of the compounds when co-administered using diverse dosing schedules (i.e., consecutive vs. staggered gavage) and dosing matrixes (i.e., feed vs. gavage). Our results illustrate the ability of both methods to detect and differentiate the severity of adverse effects in the staggered and consecutive gavage groups at much lower doses than previously observed in animals co-exposed to the compounds in feed. We also demonstrate that these urinary biomarkers outperform traditional diagnostic methods and represent a powerful, non-invasive indicator of chemical-induced nephrotoxicity prior to the onset of renal dysfunction.

23022324|t|Inhibition of neurite outgrowth and alteration of cytoskeletal gene expression by sodium arsenite.
23022324|a|Arsenic compounds that are often found in drinking water increase the risk of developmental brain disorders. In this study, we performed live imaging analyses of Neuro-2a cells expressing SCAT3, a caspase-3 cleavage peptide sequence linking two fluorescent proteins; enhanced cyan fluorescence protein (ECFP) and Venus, to determine whether sodium arsenite (NaAsO(2); 0, 1, 5, or 10 muM) affects both neurite outgrowth and/or induces apoptosis with the same doses and in the same cell cultures. We observed that the area ratio of neurite to cell body in SCAT3-expressing cells was significantly reduced by 5 and 10 muM NaAsO(2), but not by 1 muM, although the emission ratio of ECFP to Venus, an endpoint of caspase-3 activity, was not changed. However, cytological assay using apoptotic and necrotic markers resulted in that apoptosis, but not necrosis, was significantly induced in Neuro-2a cells when NaAsO(2) exposure continued after the significant effects of NaAsO(2) on neurite outgrowth were found by live imaging. These results suggested that neurite outgrowth was suppressed by NaAsO(2) prior to NaAsO(2)-induced apoptosis. Next, we examined the effects of NaAsO(2) on cytoskeletal gene expression in Neuro-2a cells. NaAsO(2) increased the mRNA levels of the light and medium subunits of neurofilament and decreased the mRNA levels of tau and tubulin in a dose-dependent manner; no significant effect was found in the mRNA levels of the heavy subunit of neurofilament, microtubule-associated protein 2, or actin. The changes in cytoskeletal gene expression are likely responsible for the inhibitory effects of NaAsO(2) on neurite outgrowth.

23023136|t|Resveratrol attenuates hepatotoxicity of rats exposed to arsenic trioxide.
23023136|a|Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) is an environmental pollutant and potent toxicant to humans. However, it also shows substantial anti-cancer activity in individuals with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Unfortunately, As(2)O(3)-treated leukemia patients suffer hepatotoxicity. Resveratrol has been demonstrated to have efficient antioxidant and antineoplastic activities. The study that how As(2)O(3) in combination with resveratrol affects hepatotoxicity and arsenic accumulation in the liver is lacking, and the present study tackles this question. Wistar rats were injected with 3mg/kg As(2)O(3) on alternate days; resveratrol (8mg/kg) was administered 1h before As(2)O(3). Rats were killed on the 8th day to determine histological liver damage, the antioxidant enzymes in serum, the ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and arsenic accumulation in the liver. In the resveratrol+As(2)O(3) group, activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase in serum and GSH/GSSG were significantly increased, histopathological effects were reduced, and arsenic accumulation markedly decreased in the liver, compared with the As(2)O(3)-treated group. Thus, resveratrol attenuated As(2)O(3)-induced hepatotoxicity by decreasing oxidative stress and arsenic accumulation in the liver. These data suggest that use of resveratrol as post-remission therapy of APL and adjunctive therapy in patients with chronic exposure to arsenic may decrease arsenic hepatotoxicity.

23042730|t|Tumor necrosis factor-alpha potentiates the cytotoxicity of amiodarone in Hepa1c1c7 cells: roles of caspase activation and oxidative stress.
23042730|a|Amiodarone (AMD), a class III antiarrhythmic drug, causes idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity in human patients. We demonstrated previously that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) plays an important role in a rat model of AMD-induced hepatotoxicity under inflammatory stress. In this study, we developed a model in vitro to study the roles of caspase activation and oxidative stress in TNF potentiation of AMD cytotoxicity. AMD caused cell death in Hepa1c1c7 cells, and TNF cotreatment potentiated its toxicity. Activation of caspases 9 and 3/7 was observed in AMD/TNF-cotreated cells, and caspase inhibitors provided minor protection from cytotoxicity. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and lipid peroxidation were observed after treatment with AMD and were further elevated by TNF cotreatment. Adding water-soluble antioxidants (trolox, N-acetylcysteine, glutathione, or ascorbate) produced only minor attenuation of AMD/TNF-induced cytotoxicity and did not influence the effect of AMD alone. On the other hand, alpha-tocopherol (TOCO), which reduced lipid peroxidation and ROS generation, prevented AMD toxicity and caused pronounced reduction in cytotoxicity from AMD/TNF cotreatment. alpha-TOCO plus a pancaspase inhibitor completely abolished AMD/TNF-induced cytotoxicity. In summary, activation of caspases and oxidative stress were observed after AMD/TNF cotreatment, and caspase inhibitors and a lipid-soluble free-radical scavenger attenuated AMD/TNF-induced cytotoxicity.

23047022|t|Characterisation of acetylcholinesterase release from neuronal cells.
23047022|a|Although acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is primarily a hydrolytic enzyme, metabolising the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in cholinergic synapses, it also has some non-catalytic functions in the brain which are far less well characterised. AChE was shown to be secreted or shed from the neuronal cell surface like several other membrane proteins, such as the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Since AChE does not possess a transmembrane domain, its anchorage in the membrane is established via the Proline Rich Membrane Anchor (PRiMA), a transmembrane protein. Both the subunit oligomerisation and membrane anchor of AChE are shared by a related enzyme, butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), the physiological function of which in the brain is unclear. In this work, we have assayed the relative activities of AChE and BChE in membrane fractions and culture medium of three different neuronal cell lines, namely the neuroblastoma cell lines SH-SY5Y and NB7 and the mouse basal forebrain cell line SN56. In an effort to understand the shedding process of AChE, we have used several pharmacological treatments, which showed that it is likely to be mediated in part by an EDTA- and batimastat-sensitive, but GM6001-insensitive metalloprotease, with the possible additional involvement of a thiol isomerase. Cellular release of AChE by SH-SY5Y is significantly enhanced by the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) agonists carbachol or muscarine, with the effect of carbachol blocked by the mAChR antagonist atropine. AChE has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and it has been shown that it accelerates formation and increases toxicity of amyloid fibrils, which have been closely linked to the pathology of AD. In light of this, greater understanding of AChE and BChE physiology may also benefit AD research.

23052191|t|Repeat oral dose toxicity studies of melamine in rats and monkeys.
23052191|a|Melamine is an important and widely used organic industrial chemical. Recently, clinical findings of renal failure and kidney stones in infants have been associated with ingestion of melamine-contaminated infant formula. To understand the toxicity and clinical outcome of melamine exposure, repeated oral dose studies in rats and monkeys were performed to characterize the subchronic toxicity of melamine. Assessment of toxicity was based on mortality, clinical signs, body weights, ophthalmic findings, clinical pathology, gross pathology, organ weights, and microscopic observations. The first rat study was intended to be a 14-day oral study followed by an 8-day recovery period. The dose levels were 140, 700, and 1,400 mg/kg/day (lowered to 1,000 mg/kg/day subsequently due to mortality). Oral administration of melamine at 700 mg/kg/day for 14 consecutive days in rats produced compound-related clinical signs (red urine), decreased body weights, and changes in clinical pathology (increased serum urea nitrogen and creatinine) and anatomical pathology (renal tubular cell debris, crystal deposition, and hyperactive regeneration of renal tubular epithelium). The kidney was identified as the target organ. Oral administration at 1,400 mg/kg/day (subsequently lowered to 1,000 mg/kg/day) resulted in animal death and moribundity. There were no treatment-related findings in the 140 mg/kg/day group. There were no compound-related findings in the high-dose recovery animals. The second rat study was a 5-day oral toxicity study with genomic biomarkers assayed in the kidney tissues. At the top dose of 1,050 mg/kg/day, similar clinical and anatomical pathology findings as described above were observed. The genes measured, Kim-1, Clu, Spp1, A2m, Lcn2, Tcfrsf12a, Gpnmb, and CD44, were significantly up-regulated (fivefold to 550-fold), while Tff3 was significantly down-regulated (fivefold). These results indicated that genomic markers could sensitively diagnose melamine-induced kidney injury. A 3-month oral study with 4-week recovery in monkeys was also conducted. In this monkey study, the animals were treated with melamine at doses of 60, 200, or 700 mg/kg/day. The administration of 700 mg/kg/day melamine by nasal-gastric gavage to monkeys resulted in test article-related clinical signs including turbid and whitish urine, urine crystals, red blood cell changes, increased serum alanine aminotransferase and kidney and/or liver weights, and microscopic findings including nephrotoxicity, pericarditis, and increased hematopoiesis. Nephrotoxicity was also noted at 200 mg/kg/day. It was concluded that the kidney is the primary target organ and the NOAEL was estimated to be 140 mg/kg/day in rats following a 14-day oral administration and 60 mg/kg/day in the monkey study.

23063590|t|Artemisinic acid inhibits melanogenesis through downregulation of C/EBP alpha-dependent expression of HMG-CoA reductase gene.
23063590|a|Cholesterol is associated with the regulation of melanogenesis which is the major physiological defense against solar irradiation. The present study was designed to determine the effects of artemisinic acid on melanogenesis and its mechanisms of action in human epidermal melanocytes. In this study, we found that artemisinic acid inhibited melanin content. The mRNA levels of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and its downstream genes tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein (TRP)-1, and TRP-2 were reduced by artemisinic acid treatment. Additionally, the mRNA levels of melanogenesis-related genes (c-KIT, stem cell factor (SCF), and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF)) were down-regulated by artemisinic acid. Furthermore, cAMP production and protein kinase A (PKA) activity were suppressed by artemisinic acid. Moreover, attempts to elucidate a possible mechanism underlying the artemisinic acid-mediated effects revealed that artemisinic acid regulated melanogenesis by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis through downregulation of the hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA (HMG CoA) reductase gene, which was mediated through reduced expression of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) alpha gene. Taken together, these findings indicate that the inhibition of melanogenesis by artemisinic acid occurs through reduced expression of the HMG CoA reductase gene, which is mediated by C/EBP alpha inhibition and suggest that artemisinic acid may be useful as a hyperpigmentation inhibitor.

23063874|t|NCTC 2544 and IL-18 production: a tool for the identification of contact allergens.
23063874|a|Progress in understanding the mechanisms of skin sensitization, provides us with the opportunity to develop in vitro tests as an alternative to in vivo sensitization testing. Keratinocytes play a key role in all phases of skin sensitization. We have recently identified interleukin-18 (IL-18) production in keratinocyte as a potentially useful endpoint for determination of contact sensitization potential of low molecular weight chemicals. The aim of the present article is to further exploit the performance of the NCTC 2544 assay. NCTC 2544 is a commercially available skin epithelial-like cell line originating from normal human skin, which posses a good expression of cytochrome P450-dependent enzymatic activities. Cells were exposed to contact allergens (2-bromo-2-bromomethyl glutaronitrile, cinnamaldehyde, citral, diethylmaleate, dinitrochlorobenzene, glyoxal, 2-mercaptobenzothiazole, nickel sulfate, 4-nitrobenzylbromide, oxazolone, penicillin G, resorcinol, tetramethylthiuram disulfide), to pre- pro-haptens (cinnamyl alcohol, eugenol, isoeugenol, p-phenylediamine), to respiratory allergens (ammonium hexachloroplatinate, diphenylmethane diisocyanate, glutaraldehyde, hexamethylenediisocyanate, maleic anhydride, trimellitic anhydride) and to irritants (benzaldehyde, cholorobenzene, diethylphtalate, hydrobenzoic acid, lactic acid, octanoic acid, phenol, salicylic acid, sodium lauryl sulphate, sulfamic acid). Cell associated IL-18 was evaluated 24 later by ELISA. At not-cytotoxic concentrations (cell viability higher of 80%, as assessed by MTT reduction assay), all contact sensitizers, including pre-pro-haptens, induced a dose-related increase in IL-18, whereas both irritants, with the exception of sulfamic acid, and respiratory allergens failed. A total of 33 chemicals were tested, with an overall accuracy of 97%. Overall, results obtained indicated that cell-associated IL-18 might provide an in vitro tool for identification and discrimination of contact vs. respiratory allergens and/or irritants.

23064031|t|Inhibition of EGF/EGFR activation with naphtho[1,2-b]furan-4,5-dione blocks migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells.
23064031|a|Naphtho[1,2-b]furan-4,5-dione (NFD), a bioactive component of Avicennia marina, has been demonstrated to display anti-cancer activity. Activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-induced signaling pathway has been correlated with cancer metastasis in various tumors, including breast carcinoma. We use EGF as a metastatic inducer of MDA-MB-231 cells to investigate the effect of NFD on cell migration and invasion. NFD suppressed EGF-mediated protein levels of c-Jun and c-Fos, and reduced MMP-9 expression and activity, concomitantly with a marked inhibition on cell migration and invasion without obvious cellular cytotoxicity. NFD abrogated EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGF receptor (EGFR) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt. The specific PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, blocked significantly EGF-induced cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 inhibited EGF-induced MMP-9 expression, cell migration and invasion, as well as the activation of PI3K/Akt, suggesting that PI3K/Akt activation occur downstream of EGFR activation. These findings suggest that NFD inhibited the EGF-induced invasion and migration of MDA-MB-231 cells via EGFR-dependent PI3K/Akt signaling, leading to the down-regulation of MMP-9 expression. These results provide a novel mechanism to explain the role of NFD as a potent anti-metastatic agent in MDA-MB-231 cells.

23081912|t|Fungicide prochloraz and environmental pollutant dioxin induce the ABCG2 transporter in bovine mammary epithelial cells by the arylhydrocarbon receptor signaling pathway.
23081912|a|The molecular mechanisms by which environmental pollutants including 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) or widely used imidazole fungicide prochloraz display their toxic effects in vertebrates are still not well understood. Using computer analysis, we recently identified nuclear aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) binding sites termed "dioxin response elements" (DREs) in the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of efflux transporter ABCG2 (Accession No. EU570105) from the bovine mammary gland. As these regulatory motifs mediate regulation of target genes by AhR agonists including TCDD and prochloraz, we have systematically investigated the effect of both contaminants on functional ABCG2 transport activity in primary bovine mammary epithelial cells. TCDD or prochloraz doubled ABCG2-mediated Hoechst H33342 secretion. This effect was almost completely reversed by specific ABCG2 inhibitor Ko143. In further mechanistic studies, we showed that this induction was due to binding of activated AhR to DRE sequences in the ABCG2 5'-UTR. Receptor binding was significantly reduced by specific AhR antagonist salicyl amide. Induction of AhR by TCDD and prochloraz resulted in a time- and dose-dependent increase of ABCG2 gene expression and transporter protein levels. As ABCG2 represents the main mammary transporter for xenobiotics including drugs and toxins, exposure to prevalent AhR agonists may enhance transporter-mediated secretion of potential harmful compounds into milk. Through identification of mammary ABCG2 as a novel target gene of pesticide prochloraz and dioxin, our results may therefore help to improve the protection of breast-feeding infants and the consumer of dairy products.

23085120|t|Bis(12)-hupyridone, a novel acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, protects against glutamate-induced neuronal excitotoxicity via activating alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor/phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt cascade.
23085120|a|Bis(12)-hupyridone (B12H), derived from the Chinese medicinal component huperzine A, was originally designed as a novel acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. In this paper, we report that B12H (24-h pretreatment) effectively blocked glutamate-induced neuronal excitotoxicity in cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs). However, the huge discrepancy between the EC50 value and IC50 value of B12H, to protect against neuronal toxicity (0.09 muM) and to block the NMDA receptor (21.8 muM) respectively, suggests that the neuroprotection of B12H might be not primarily due to the blockade of the NMDA receptor. Pretreatment by specific antagonists of alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7nAChR), but not muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) or alpha4beta2nAChR, decreased the neuroprotection of B12H. The neuroprotection of B12H could also be abolished by the pretreatment of specific PI3-K inhibitors. Furthermore, B12H restored the suppressed activation of the Akt pathway caused by glutamate as evidenced by the decreased expressions of pSer473-Akt and pSer9-GSK3beta. All these results suggest that B12H substantially protected CGNs against glutamate-induced neuronal excitotoxicity via activating alpha7nAChR/PI3-K/Akt cascade.

23086748|t|Effects of silver nanoparticles on the liver and hepatocytes in vitro.
23086748|a|With the increasing use and incorporation of nanoparticles (NPs) into consumer products, screening for potential toxicity is necessary to ensure customer safety. NPs have been shown to translocate to the bloodstream following inhalation and ingestion, and such studies demonstrate that the liver is an important organ for accumulation. Silver (Ag) NPs are highly relevant for human exposure due to their use in food contact materials, dietary supplements, and antibacterial wound treatments. Due to the large number of different NPs already used in various products and being developed for new applications, it is essential that relevant, quick, and cheap methods of in vitro risk assessment suitable for these new materials are established. Therefore, this study used a simple hepatocytes model combined with an in vivo injection model to simulate the passage of a small amount of NPs into the bloodstream following exposure, e.g., via ingestion or inhalation, and examined the potential of Ag NPs of 20 nm diameter to cause toxicity, inflammation, and oxidative stress in the liver following in vivo exposures of female Wistar rats via iv injection to 50 mug of NPs and in vitro exposures using the human hepatocyte cell line C3A. We found that Ag NPs were highly cytotoxic to hepatocytes (LC(50) lactate dehydrogenase: 2.5 mug/cm(2)) and affected hepatocyte homeostasis by reducing albumin release. At sublethal concentrations with normal cell or tissue morphology, Ag NPs were detected in cytoplasm and nuclei of hepatocytes. We observed similar effects of Ag NPs on inflammatory mediator expression in vitro and in vivo with increase of interleukin-8 (IL-8)/macrophage inflammatory protein 2, IL-1RI, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression in both models and increased IL-8 protein release in vitro. This article presents evidence of the potential toxicity and inflammogenic potential of Ag NPs in the liver following ingestion. In addition, the similarities between in vitro and in vivo responses are striking and encouraging for future reduction, refinement, and replacement of animal studies by the use of hepatocyte cell lines in particle risk assessment.

23091169|t|Identification of Dlk1-Dio3 imprinted gene cluster noncoding RNAs as novel candidate biomarkers for liver tumor promotion.
23091169|a|The molecular events during nongenotoxic carcinogenesis and their temporal order are poorly understood but thought to include long-lasting perturbations of gene expression. Here, we have investigated the temporal sequence of molecular and pathological perturbations at early stages of phenobarbital (PB) mediated liver tumor promotion in vivo. Molecular profiling (mRNA, microRNA [miRNA], DNA methylation, and proteins) of mouse liver during 13 weeks of PB treatment revealed progressive increases in hepatic expression of long noncoding RNAs and miRNAs originating from the Dlk1-Dio3 imprinted gene cluster, a locus that has recently been associated with stem cell pluripotency in mice and various neoplasms in humans. PB induction of the Dlk1-Dio3 cluster noncoding RNA (ncRNA) Meg3 was localized to glutamine synthetase-positive hypertrophic perivenous hepatocytes, suggesting a role for beta-catenin signaling in the dysregulation of Dlk1-Dio3 ncRNAs. The carcinogenic relevance of Dlk1-Dio3 locus ncRNA induction was further supported by in vivo genetic dependence on constitutive androstane receptor and beta-catenin pathways. Our data identify Dlk1-Dio3 ncRNAs as novel candidate early biomarkers for mouse liver tumor promotion and provide new opportunities for assessing the carcinogenic potential of novel compounds.

23100158|t|Apoptosis initiation of beta-ionone in SGC-7901 gastric carcinoma cancer cells via a PI3K-AKT pathway.
23100158|a|beta-ionone has been shown to hold potent anti-proliferative and apoptosis induction properties in vitro and in vivo. To investigate the effects of beta-ionone on apoptosis initiation and its possible mechanisms of action, we qualified cell apoptosis, proteins related to apoptosis and a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway in human gastric adenocarcinoma cancer SGC-7901 cells. The results demonstrated that beta-ionone-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in SGC-7901 cells treated with beta-ionone (25, 50, 100 and 200 mumol/L) for 24 h. beta-ionone was also shown to induce the expression of cleaved-caspase-3 and inhibit bcl-2 expression in SGC-7901 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The significantly decreased levels of p-PI3K and p-AKT expression were observed in SGC-7901 cells after beta-ionone treatments in a time- and dose-dependent manner (P &lt; 0.01). Thus, the apoptosis induction in SGC-7901 cells by beta-ionone may be regulated through a PI3K-AKT pathway. These results demonstrate a potential mechanism by which beta-ionone to induce apoptosis initiation in SGC-7901 cells.

23100159|t|Enhanced carcinogenicity by coexposure to arsenic and iron and a novel remediation system for the elements in well drinking water.
23100159|a|Various carcinomas including skin cancer are explosively increasing in arsenicosis patients who drink arsenic-polluted well water, especially in Bangladesh. Although well drinking water in the cancer-prone areas contains various elements, very little is known about the effects of elements except arsenic on carcinogenicity. In order to clarify the carcinogenic effects of coexposure to arsenic and iron, anchorage-independent growth and invasion in human untransformed HaCaT and transformed A431 keratinocytes were examined. Since the mean ratio of arsenic and iron in well water was 1:10 in cancer-prone areas of Bangladesh, effects of 1 muM arsenic and 10 muM iron were investigated. Iron synergistically promoted arsenic-mediated anchorage-independent growth in untransformed and transformed keratinocytes. Iron additionally increased invasion in both types of keratinocytes. Activities of c-SRC and ERK that regulate anchorage-independent growth and invasion were synergistically enhanced in both types of keratinocytes. Our results suggest that iron promotes arsenic-mediated transformation of untransformed keratinocytes and progression of transformed keratinocytes. We then developed a low-cost and high-performance adsorbent composed of a hydrotalcite-like compound for arsenic and iron. The adsorbent rapidly reduced concentrations of both elements from well drinking water in cancer-prone areas of Bangladesh to levels less than those in WHO health-based guidelines for drinking water. Thus, we not only demonstrated for the first time increased carcinogenicity by coexposure to arsenic and iron but also proposed a novel remediation system for well drinking water.

23103283|t|Mancozeb-induced behavioral deficits precede structural neural degeneration.
23103283|a|Manganese-containing fungicides like Mancozeb have been associated with neurodegenerative conditions like Parkinson's disease. We examined the behavioral damage and differential neuronal vulnerability resulting from Mancozeb exposure using Caenorhabditis elegans, an important mid-trophic level soil organism that is also a powerful model for studying mechanisms of environmental pollutant-induced neurodegenerative disease. The dopamine-mediated swim to crawl locomotory transition behavior is exquisitely vulnerable to Mancozeb, with functional impairment preceding markers of neuronal structural damage. The damage is partially rescued in mutants lacking the divalent metal transporter, SMF-1, demonstrating that some, but not all, of the damage is mediated by manganese. Increasing concentrations of Mancozeb recruit additional behavioral dysfunction, notably serotonin-mediated egg-laying behavior, but without evident serotonergic neuronal structural damage. Thus, measurements of behavioral dysfunction are a sensitive early marker of fungicide toxicity that could be exploited to examine further mechanisms of neuron damage and possible therapeutic interventions. These results also provide important insight into the consequences of fungicide use on the ecological behavior of nematodes.

23103426|t|Mitochondrial electron transfer chain complexes inhibition by different organochalcogens.
23103426|a|Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a pivotal role in the cell toxicology and death decision. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of three organocompounds (ebselen [Ebs], diphenyl diselenide [(PhSe)(2)] and diphenyl ditelluride [(PhTe)(2)]) on mitochondrial complexes (I, II, I-III, II-III and IV) activity from rat liver and kidney to determine their potential role as molecular targets of organochalcogens. All studied organochalcogens caused a statistically significant inhibition of the mitochondrial complex I activity. Ebs and (PhTe)(2) caused a statistically significant inhibition of the mitochondrial complex II activity in both hepatic and renal membranes. Hepatic mitochondrial complex II activity was practically unchanged by (PhSe)(2), whereas it significantly inhibited renal complex II activity. Mitochondrial complex IV activity was practically unchanged by the organochalcogens. Furthermore, organochalcogens inhibited the mitochondrial respiration supported by complex I or complex II substrates. The inhibitory effect of Ebs, (PhSe)(2) and (PhTe)(2) on mitochondrial complex I was prevented by NADH, but it was not prevented by catalase (CAT) and/or superoxide dismutase (SOD). Additionally, the organochalcogens-induced inhibition of complex I and II was completely reversed by reduced glutathione (GSH). In conclusion, Ebs, (PhSe)(2) and (PhTe)(2) were more effective inhibitors of renal and hepatic mitochondrial complex I than complex II, whereas complexes III and IV were little modified by these compounds. Taking into account the presented results, we suggest that organochalcogen-induced mitochondrial complexes I and II inhibition can be mediated by their thiol oxidation activity, i.e., Ebs, (PhSe)(2) and (PhTe)(2) can oxidize critical thiol groups from mitochondrial complexes I and II. So, mitochondrial dysfunction can be considered an important factor in the toxicity of Ebs, (PhSe)(2) and (PhTe)(2).

23103562|t|TNF-alpha-mediated NF-kappaB survival signaling impairment by cisplatin enhances JNK activation allowing synergistic apoptosis of renal proximal tubular cells.
23103562|a|Cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity is an important limiting factor for cisplatin use. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is known to contribute to cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity by inducing an inflammatory process aggravating the primary injury, thereby resulting in acute kidney injury (AKI). The present study investigates the pathways synergistically activated by cisplatin and TNF-alpha responsible for TNF-alpha-enhanced cisplatin-induced renal cell injury. To do so, immortalized renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (IM-PTECs) were co-treated with TNF-alpha and cisplatin. Under these conditions, cisplatin induced dose-dependent apoptosis in IM-PTECs, which was significantly enhanced by TNF-alpha. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that cisplatin inhibited the typical TNF-alpha response and cisplatin/TNF-alpha treatment up-regulated cell death pathways while it down-regulated survival pathways compared to cisplatin alone. In concordance, the gene expression levels of kidney injury markers combined with activation of specific inflammatory mediators were enhanced by cisplatin/TNF-alpha treatment, resembling the in vivo cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity response. Furthermore, combined cisplatin/TNF-alpha treatment inhibited NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and NF-kappaB-mediated gene transcription leading to enhanced and prolonged JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation. JNK sustained activation further inhibited NF-kappaB signaling via a feedback loop mechanism. This led to an alteration in the transcription of the NF-kappaB-induced anti-apoptotic genes c-IAP2, Bcl-XL, Bruce and Bcl2 and pro-apoptotic genes Bfk and Xaf1 and consequently to sensitization of the IM-PTECs toward cisplatin/TNF-alpha-induced toxicity. In conclusion, our findings support a model whereby renal cells exposed to both cisplatin and TNF-alpha switch into a more pro-apoptotic and inflammatory program by altering their NF-kappaB/JNK/c-Jun balance.

23123250|t|A combination of [+] and [-]-Huperzine A improves protection against soman toxicity compared to [+]-Huperzine A in guinea pigs.
23123250|a|The neuropathologic mechanisms after exposure to lethal doses of nerve agent are complex and involve multiple biochemical pathways. Effective treatment requires drugs that can simultaneously protect by reversible binding to the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and blocking cascades of seizure related brain damage, inflammation, neuronal degeneration as well as promoting induction of neuroregeneration. [-]-Huperzine A ([-]-Hup A), is a naturally occurring potent reversible AChE inhibitor that penetrates the blood-brain barrier. It also has several neuroprotective effects including modification of beta-amyloid peptide, reduction of oxidative stress, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and induction and regulation of nerve growth factor. Toxicities at higher doses restrict the neuroporotective ability of [-]-Hup A for treatment. The synthetic stereoisomer, [+]-Hup A, is less toxic due to poor AChE inhibition and is suitable for both pre-/post-exposure treatments of nerve agent toxicity. [+]-Hup A block the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced seizure in rats, reduce excitatory amino acid induced neurotoxicity and also prevent soman induced toxicity with minimum performance decrement. Unique combinations of two stereo-isomers of Hup A may provide an excellent pre/post-treatment drug for the nerve agent induced seizure/status epilepticus. We investigated a combination of [+]-Hup A with a small dose of [-]-Hup A ([+] and [-]-Hup A) against soman toxicity. Our data showed that pretreatment with a combination [+] and [-]-Hup A significantly increased the survival rate and reduced behavioral abnormalities after exposure to 1.2 x LD(50) soman compared to [+]-Hup A in guinea pigs. In addition, [+] and [-]-Hup A pretreatment inhibited the development of high power of EEG better than [+]-Hup A pretreatment alone. These data suggest that a combination of [+] and [-]-Hup A offers better protection than [+]-Hup A and serves as a potent medical countermeasure against lethal dose nerve agent toxicity in guinea pigs.

23123298|t|Helenalin-induced apoptosis is dependent on production of reactive oxygen species and independent of induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress in renal cell carcinoma.
23123298|a|Helenalin, a sesquiterpene lactone, exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor activities. Here, we investigated whether helenalin could induce apoptosis in human renal carcinoma Caki cells. Helenalin increased apoptosis in dose dependent manner in Caki cells, and also induced apoptosis in other carcinoma cells, such as human renal carcinoma ACHN cells, human colon carcinoma HT29 and HCT116 cells. We found that helenalin markedly induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related genes, such as regulated in development and DNA damage responses (REDD) 1, activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4) and/or the CCAAT enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein (CHOP). However, down-regulation of ATF4 and/or CHOP expression by siRNA had no effect on helenalin-induced apoptosis in Caki and HCT116 cells. Helenalin increased production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, ROS scavengers, N-acetylcystine (NAC), and glutathione ethyl ester (GEE), reduced helenalin-induced apoptosis. Taken together, helenalin induced apoptosis via ROS generation in human renal carcinoma Caki cells.

23134735|t|Development and validation of a high-throughput intrinsic ATPase activity assay for the discovery of MEKK2 inhibitors.
23134735|a|The kinase MEKK2 (MAP3K2) has recently been implicated in tumor growth and metastasis. Thus, selective inhibition of MEKK2 may be a novel strategy for cancer therapy. To identify inhibitors of MEKK2 kinase activity, we have developed a novel activity assay for MEKK2 based on the discovery that recombinant purified MEKK2 has intrinsic ATPase activity. This MEKK2 ATPase assay was validated for enzyme identity and enzymatic purity by multiple methods including mass spectrometry analysis, testing different sources of MEKK2 and comparing ATPase assay IC50 data for multiple inhibitors to literature values and to IC50 data generated using MEKK2 binding and transphosphorylation assays. Taken together, these data indicated that genuine MEKK2 activity was being measured in this assay and no other ATPases contributed to the signal. A miniaturized version of the assay was validated for high-throughput screening, and compound libraries were screened. The screening hits generated comparable potencies in the MEKK2 intrinsic ATPase, binding, and transphosphorylation assays. We identified a novel MEKK2 inhibitor and confirmed that crizotinib and bosutinib are potent in vitro inhibitors of MEKK2 activity with IC50 values of &lt;100 nM. Thus, this assay has utility for the discovery of small-molecule inhibitors of MEKK2 activity.

23142325|t|The role of mitochondria and biotransformation in abamectin-induced cytotoxicity in isolated rat hepatocytes.
23142325|a|Abamectin (ABA), which belongs to the family of avermectins, is used as a parasiticide; however, ABA poisoning can impair liver function. In a previous study using isolated rat liver mitochondria, we observed that ABA inhibited the activity of adenine nucleotide translocator and FoF1-ATPase. The aim of this study was to characterize the mechanism of ABA toxicity in isolated rat hepatocytes and to evaluate whether this effect is dependent on its metabolism. The toxicity of ABA was assessed by monitoring oxygen consumption and mitochondrial membrane potential, intracellular ATP concentration, cell viability, intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis, release of cytochrome c, caspase 3 activity and necrotic cell death. ABA reduces cellular respiration in cells energized with glutamate and malate or succinate. The hepatocytes that were previously incubated with proadifen, a cytochrome P450 inhibitor, are more sensitive to the compound as observed by a rapid decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential accompanied by reductions in ATP concentration and cell viability and a disruption of intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis followed by necrosis. Our results indicate that ABA biotransformation reduces its toxicity, and its toxic action is related to the inhibition of mitochondrial activity, which leads to decreased synthesis of ATP followed by cell death.

23146690|t|Synergistic anti-cancer effects of resveratrol and chemotherapeutic agent clofarabine against human malignant mesothelioma MSTO-211H cells.
23146690|a|Dietary phytochemicals as adjuvants have been suggested to play important roles in enhancing chemotherapeutic potential owing to multitargeted chemopreventive properties and lack of substantial toxicity. Here, we investigated the efficacy of the combined treatment of various phytochemicals with the anticancer drug clofarabine in malignant mesothelioma MSTO-211H cells and normal mesothelial MeT-5A cells. The combined treatment of resveratrol and clofarabine produced a synergistic antiproliferative effect in MSTO-211H cells, but not in MeT-5A cells. In MSTO-211H cells, the nuclear accumulation of Sp1 and the levels of p-Akt, Sp1, c-Met, cyclin D1, and p21 were effectively decreased by the combined treatment of them. In combination with clofarabine, the ability of resveratrol to reduce the contents of Sp1 and its target gene products was also evident in a time- and dose-dependent experiment. The inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase using Ly294002 augmented a decrease in the p21 level induced by their combination, but it showed no significant effects on expression of Sp1 and cyclin D1. Taken together, the data provide evidence that the synergistic antiproliferative effect of resveratrol and clofarabine is linked to the inhibition of Akt and Sp1 activities, and suggest that this combination may have therapeutic value in treatment of malignant mesothelioma.

23146691|a|High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein acts as a potent proinflammatory cytokine and is involved in the pathogenesis of several vascular diseases, such as, systemic vasculitis and sepsis. Emodin-6-O-beta-D-glucoside (EG) is a new active compound from Reynoutria japonica, and its biologic activities have not been previously investigated. In this study, we first investigated the antiinflammatory activities of EG on HMGB1-mediated proinflammatory responses in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and in a murine cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-model of sepsis in mice. EG was found to suppress the release of HMGB1, the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) by HMGB1 in HUVECs, and to inhibit HMGB1-mediated hyperpermeability and leukocyte migration in mice. In the CLP model, HMGB1 was highly released, but this release was prevented by EG. Furthermore, EG also increased the survival times of CLP administered mice. Collectively, this study shows EG can protect barrier integrity and inhibit HMGB1-mediated inflammatory responses, which suggests a potential use as a therapy for sepsis or septic shock.

23146695|t|Puerarin mediates hepatoprotection against CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis rats through attenuation of inflammation response and amelioration of metabolic function.
23146695|a|This study was designed to evaluate the potential effects of puerarin (PR), an effective isoflavonoid compound purified from Pueraria lobata, in treating hepatic fibrosis (HF) rats induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4), 2 mL kg(-1) d(-1)). Compared to model control, PR treatment effectively lowered the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin (Alb), total protein (TP) in HF rats. Masson stained analysis showed that the condition of HF rats was mitigated. Meanwhile, the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) expressions were significantly down-regulated at protein level by PR intervention. Additionally, the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was elevated, while the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) was lessened in liver tissue. As revealed by immunohistochemistry assay, PR therapy resulted in reduced production of transforming growth factor-betal (TGF-betal). Moreover, it also was attributed to decreased mRNA level of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) using RT-PCR analysis. These findings demonstrate that puerarin successfully reverses hepatotoxicity in CCl(4)-induced HF rats via the underlying mechanisms of regulating serum enzymes and attenuating TNF-alpha/NF-kappaB pathway for anti-inflammation response, as well as improving metabolic function in liver tissue.

23146748|t|Decreased levels of AKR1B1 and AKR1B10 in cancerous endometrium compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissue.
23146748|a|Endometrial cancer is associated with enhanced cell proliferation due to high concentrations of estrogens, and decreased cell differentiation due to low levels of progesterone and retinoic acid. It is also associated with aberrant inflammatory responses and concomitant increased production of prostaglandins. The human members of the aldo-keto reductase 1B (AKR1B) subfamily, AKR1B1 and AKR1B10, have roles in these processes and can thus be implicated in endometrial cancer. To date, there have been no reports on the expression of AKR1B1 in endometrial cancer, while AKR1B10 has only been studied at the cellular level. To evaluate the roles of these AKR1B enzymes, we investigated expression of AKR1B1 and AKR1B10 in 47 paired samples of cancerous and adjacent control endometrium at the mRNA and protein levels, by quantitative PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry staining. There were significantly lower mRNA and protein levels of AKR1B1 in cancerous tissues compared to adjacent endometrium. The gene expression of AKR1B10 at the mRNA level was significantly increased, while there were significantly decreased protein levels. Immunohistochemistry revealed that both of these enzymes were present in all of the samples, and are located in epithelial cells of cancerous and control endometrial glands. Elevated levels in adjacent non-cancerous tissues imply that these enzymes are more important in the initiation of endometrial cancer than in its progression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the expression of AKR1B1 and AKR1B10 in endometrial cancer. Further studies are needed to define the precise roles of these enzymes in the pathogenesis of endometrial cancer.

23152186|t|Arsenic activates endothelin-1 Gi protein-coupled receptor signaling to inhibit stem cell differentiation in adipogenesis.
23152186|a|Dysfunctional lipid and glucose metabolism contribute to metabolic syndrome-a major public health concern that enhances cardiovascular disease risk. Arsenic (As(III)) exposure may increase metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease risk by impairing adipose tissue differentiation, function, and insulin sensitivity through pathogenic mechanisms that remain unclear. We hypothesized that As(III) signals through the Pertussis toxin (Ptx) sensitive, Gi protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) to impair adipogenesis, as previously demonstrated for its stimulation of vascular oxidant generation, angiogenesis, and remodeling. Because both As(III) and GPCR ligands inhibit progenitor cell differentiation into adipocytes, we investigated the hypothesis in a model of low-passage human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC). As(III) (0.1-1.0 microM) suppressed dexamethasone/insulin-induced hMSC adipogenesis, as indicated by decreased transcriptional promoters of differentiation, decreased fat droplet formation, and decreased expression of differentiated adipocyte markers, such as adiponectin and perilipin. Preincubating hMSC with Ptx prevented 90% of the suppressive effect of As(III). Selective competitive antagonists of Gi-coupled endothelin-1 type A and B receptors were ~60% effective in blocking As(III) inhibition and combination of antagonists to both receptors were 85% effective. In contrast, antagonists to the sphingosine-1-phosphate type 1 receptor (previously shown to mediate As(III) vascular effects) or the angiotensin II type 1 receptor were ineffective in blocking As(III) effects. These studies suggest a majority of arsenic-inhibited adipocyte differentiation, and metabolism requires endothelin-1 GPCRs and that As(III) effects on GPCR signaling are tissue and context specific. This may represent a significant mechanism for the contribution of arsenic exposure to increased metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.

23159986|t|Renal biomarker changes associated with hyaline droplet nephropathy in rats are time and potentially compound dependent.
23159986|a|Alpha 2u-globulin mediated hyaline droplet nephropathy (HDN) is a male rat specific lesion induced when a compound or metabolite binds to alpha 2u-globulin. The objective of this study was to investigate if the newer and more sensitive renal biomarkers would be altered with HDN as well as be able to distinguish between HDN and oxidative stress-induced kidney injury. Rats were dosed orally for 7 days to determine (1) if HDN (induced by 2-propanol or D-limonene) altered the newer renal biomarkers and not BUN or creatinine, (2) if renal biomarkers could distinguish between HDN and oxidative stress-induced kidney injury (induced by potassium bromate), (3) sensitivity of HDN-induced renal biomarker changes relative to D-limonene dose, and (4) reversibility of HDN and renal biomarkers, using vehicle or 300 mg/kg/day D-limonene with 7 days of dosing and necropsies scheduled over the period of Days 8-85. HDN-induced renal biomarker changes in male rats were potentially compound specific: (1) 2-propanol induced mild HDN without increased renal biomarkers, (2) potassium bromate induced moderate HDN with increased clusterin, and (3) D-limonene induced marked HDN with increased alphaGST, muGST and albumin. Administration of potassium bromate did not result in oxidative stress-induced kidney injury, based on histopathology and renal biomarkers creatinine and BUN. The compound D-limonene induced a dose dependent increase in HDN severity and renal biomarker changes without altering BUN, creatinine or NAG: (1) minimal induction of HDN and no altered biomarkers at 10 mg/kg/day, (2) mild induction of HDN with increased alphaGST and muGST at 50 mg/kg/day and (3) marked induction of HDN with increased alphaGST, muGST and albumin at 300 mg/kg/day. HDN induced by D-limonene was reversible, but with a variable renal biomarker pattern over time: Day 8 there was increased alphaGST, muGST and albumin; on Day 15 increased clusterin, albumin and Kim-1. In summary, HDN altered the newer and more sensitive renal biomarkers in a time and possibly compound dependent manner.

23164673|t|The glycogen synthase kinase-3beta/nuclear factor-kappa B pathway is involved in cinobufagin-induced apoptosis in cultured osteosarcoma cells.
23164673|a|Cinobufagin, a major component of cinobufacini (huachansu), is an important cardenolidal steroid. Several studies have suggested that cinobufagin has potent anti-cancer effects. The present study examines the apoptosis-inducing activity and the underlying mechanism of action of cinobufagin in osteosarcoma (OS) cells. Our results showed that cinobufagin potently inhibited the proliferation of U2OS, MG63 and SaOS-2 cells. Significant increases in G2/M cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in OS cells were also observed. The expression levels of several apoptotic proteins were assessed after cinobufagin treatment in U2OS cells. Among them, xIAP, cIAP-1, survivin and Bcl-2 levels decreased remarkably, while the levels of Bax and cleaved-PARP increased. Furthermore, we validated the inhibition of GSK-3beta/NF-kappaB signaling following cinobufagin treatment. Western blots showed a decrease in nuclear p65 protein expression after exposure to different concentrations of cinobufagin, while the phosphorylation of GSK-3beta was simultaneously increased. Transduction with constitutively active forms of GSK-3beta could protect against the downregulation of p65 and upregulation of cleaved-PARP that are induced by cinobufagin treatment. However, combined treatment with cinobufagin and SB216367 resulted in a significant reduction in p65 and an increase in cleaved-PARP in U2OS cells. Altogether, these results show that cinobufagin is a promising agent for the treatment of OS. These studies are the first to reveal the involvement of the GSK-3beta/NF-kappaB pathway in cinobufagin-induced apoptosis.

23164921|t|Catalpol inhibits LPS plus IFN-gamma-induced inflammatory response in astrocytes primary cultures.
23164921|a|A large body of evidence suggests that the inflammatory reaction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Our previous studies described the neuroprotective effects of catalpol in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory models, in which catalpol was shown to prevent mesencephalic neuron death and ameliorate cognitive ability animals. To further investigate the protective effect and underlying mechanism of catalpol, astrocytes were pretreated with low (0.1mM) and high dose (0.5mM) catalpol for 1h prior to LPS plus interferon-gamma stimulation. Biochemical analyses showed that NO and ROS production and iNOS activity were significantly reduced by catalpol. Data at transcriptional level also demonstrated that catalpol potently attenuated gene expressions involved in inflammation, such as iNOS, COX-2 and TLR4. In addition, our exploration further revealed that the suppressive action of catalpol on inflammation was mediated via inhibiting nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation. Collectively, these results suggest that catalpol can exert inhibitory effects on the inflammatory reaction in astrocytes and that inactivation of NF-kappaB could be the major determinant for its anti-inflammatory mechanism. Therefore, catalpol may potentially be a highly effective therapeutic agent in treating neurodegenerative diseases associated with inflammation.

23165153|t|Pathophysiological roles of aldo-keto reductases (AKR1C1 and AKR1C3) in development of cisplatin resistance in human colon cancers.
23165153|a|Cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum, CDDP) is widely used for treatment of patients with solid tumors formed in various organs including the lung, prostate and cervix, but is much less sensitive in colon and breast cancers. One major factor implicated in the ineffectiveness has been suggested to be acquisition of the CDDP resistance. Here, we established the CDDP-resistant phenotypes of human colon HCT15 cells by continuously exposing them to incremental concentrations of the drug, and monitored expressions of aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) 1A1, 1B1, 1B10, 1C1, 1C2 and 1C3. Among the six AKRs, AKR1C1 and AKR1C3 are highly induced with the CDDP resistance. The resistance lowered the sensitivity toward cellular damages evoked by oxidative stress-derived aldehydes, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal and 4-oxo-2-nonenal that are detoxified by AKR1C1 and AKR1C3. Overexpression of AKR1C1 or AKR1C3 in the parental HCT15 cells mitigated the cytotoxicity of the aldehydes and CDDP. Knockdown of both AKR1C1 and AKR1C3 in the resistant cells or treatment of the cells with specific inhibitors of the AKRs increased the sensitivity to CDDP toxicity. Thus, the two AKRs participate in the mechanism underlying the CDDP resistance probably via detoxification of the aldehydes resulting from enhanced oxidative stress. The resistant cells also showed an enhancement in proteolytic activity of proteasome accompanied by overexpression of its catalytic subunits (PSMbeta9 and PSMbeta10). Pretreatment of the resistant cells with a potent proteasome inhibitor Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-al augmented the CDDP sensitization elicited by the AKR inhibitors. Additionally, the treatment of the cells with Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-al and the AKR inhibitors induced the expressions of the two AKRs and proteasome subunits. Collectively, these results suggest the involvement of up-regulated AKR1C1, AKR1C3 and proteasome in CDDP resistance of colon cancers and support a chemotherapeutic role for their inhibitors.

23165154|t|Three-month subchronic intramuscular toxicity study of rotigotine-loaded microspheres in Cynomolgus monkeys.
23165154|a|Continuous dopaminergic stimulation (CDS) is an important drug development strategy in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Rotigotine is a non-ergoline D(3)/D(2)/D(1) dopamine receptor agonist for treating PD. As a new treatment option for CDS, rotigotine-loaded microspheres (RoMS), long-acting sustained-release microspheres with poly(lactide-co-glycolide) as drug carrier, are now being evaluated in clinical trial. In the present study, the subchronic toxicity in Cynomolgus monkeys has been characterized via intramuscular administration with RoMS at 0, 10, 40 and 160 mg/kg, weekly for 3 months with a 1-month recovery period. The NOAEL was 10 mg/kg/week. One male at 160 mg/kg died from an extensive pulmonary embolism. The major toxicological effects were associated with dopamine agonist-related pharmacodynamic properties of rotigotine (e.g., hyperactivity and stereotype, decreased serum prolactin level) and foreign body removal reaction induced by poly(lactide-co-glycolide) and carboxymethycellulose sodium (e.g., increased mononuclear cells and neutrophils, thymus atrophy and vacuolar degeneration of adrenal cortex, foreign body granuloma with foam cells accumulation at injection sites and foam cells accumulation in spleen and multiple lymph sinuses). At the end of recovery period, above findings recovered to a normal level or to a certain degree except vacuolar degeneration of adrenal gland. RoMS has exhibited high safety on monkeys.

23169610|t|The role of cytochrome P450-dependent metabolism in the regulation of mouse hepatic growth hormone signaling components and target genes by 3-methylcholanthrene.
23169610|a|3-Methylcholanthrene (MC) is a readily metabolized aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) agonist. MC disrupts expression of mouse hepatic growth hormone (GH) signaling components and suppresses cytochrome P450 2D9 (Cyp2d9), a male-specific gene controlled by pulsatile GH via signal transducer and activator of transcription 5b (STAT5b). To determine if these effects of MC depend on hepatic microsomal P450-mediated activity, we examined biologic responses to MC treatment in liver Cpr-null (LCN) mice with hepatocyte-specific conditional deletion of NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR). MC caused mild induction of Por and a hepatic inflammatory marker in wild-type mice, whereas MC caused strong induction of AHR target genes, Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2, and Cyp1b1 in wild-type and LCN mice. Two mouse hepatic STAT5b target genes, Cyp2d9 and major urinary protein 2 (Mup2), were suppressed by MC in wild-type mice, and the CYP2D9 mRNA response was maintained in LCN mice. In wild-type mice only, MC decreased hepatic GH receptor (GHR) mRNA but increased GHR protein levels. There was an apparent impairment of STAT5 phosphorylation by MC in wild-type and LCN mice, but large interanimal variation prevented achievement of statistical significance. In vehicle-treated mice, basal levels of MUP2 mRNA, GHR mRNA, GHR protein, and the activation status of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 and Akt were influenced by hepatic Por genetic status. These results indicate that the effects of MC on hepatic GH signaling components and target genes are complex, involving aspects that are both dependent and independent of hepatic microsomal P450-mediated activity.

23178380|t|Pulmonary delivery of an aerosolized recombinant human butyrylcholinesterase pretreatment protects against aerosolized paraoxon in macaques.
23178380|a|Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is the leading pretreatment candidate against exposure to organophosphates (OPs), which pose an ever increasing public and military health. Since respiratory failure is the primary cause of death following acute OP poisoning, an inhaled BChE therapeutic could prove highly efficacious in preventing acute toxicity as well as the associated delayed neuropathy. To address this, studies have been performed in mice and macaques using Chinese Hamster Ovary cells (CHO)-derived recombinant (r) BChE delivered by the pulmonary route, to examine whether the deposition of both macaque (Ma) and human (Hu) rBChE administered as aerosols (aer) favored the creation and retention of an efficient protective "pulmonary bioshield" that could scavenge incoming (inhaled) OPs in situ thereby preventing entry into the circulation and inhibition of plasma BChE and AChE on red blood cells (RBC-AChE) and in cholinergic synapses. In contrast to parenteral delivery of rBChE, which currently requires posttranslational modification for good plasma stability, an unmodified aer-rBChE pretreatment given 1-40 h prior to &gt;1 LD50 of aer-paraoxon (Px) was able to prevent inhibition of circulating cholinesterase in a dose-dependent manner. These studies are the first to show protection by rBChE against a pesticide such as paraoxon when delivered directly into the lung and bode well for the use of a non-invasive and consumer friendly method of rHuBChE delivery as a human treatment to counteract OP toxicity.

23178381|t|Aspidin PB, a phloroglucinol derivative, induces apoptosis in human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells by modulating PI3K/Akt/GSK3beta pathway.
23178381|a|Aspidin PB, a phloroglucinol derivative isolated from Dryopteris fragrans (L.) Schott, has been previously reported to exert high biological activities. In the present study, we analyzed the apoptotic mechanisms of aspidin PB on human hepatoma cell line, HepG2. Initially, aspidin PB was shown to inhibit the growth of HepG2 cells in a time and dose-dependent manner. After treatment with aspidin PB for 72 h, 48 h and 24 h using MTT assay, the IC(50) values were 10.59 muM, 20.86 muM and 46.59 muM, respectively. Aspidin PB was capable to induce apoptosis, as measured by mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim), acridine orange (AO) staining and propidium iodide (PI)/annexin V-FITC double staining. To further explore the signaling pathway of aspidin PB-mediated apoptosis, we examined PI3K/Akt related proteins. Western blot analysis revealed that aspidin PB inhibited PI3K expression, phosphorylation of Ser473 Akt and Ser9 GSK3beta followed by up-regulation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs activated gene-1 (NAG-1) expression. Similarly, the effects of aspidin PB on PI3K, Akt, GSK3beta, NAG-1 expression were abolished by treatment with the PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin. Taken together, our data suggested that the PI3K/Akt/GSK3beta signal pathway may represent one of the major mechanisms of the effects of aspidin PB on human hepatocarcinoma cells.

23182946|t|Disrupted cytoskeletal homeostasis, astrogliosis and apoptotic cell death in the cerebellum of preweaning rats injected with diphenyl ditelluride.
23182946|a|In the present report 15 day-old rats were injected with 0.3mumol of diphenyl ditelluride (PhTe)(2)/kg body weight and parameters of neurodegeneration were analyzed in slices from cerebellum 3 and 6 days afterwards. The earlier responses, at day 3 after injection, included hyperphosphorylation of intermediate filament (IF) proteins from astrocyte (glial fibrillary acidic protein - GFAP - and vimentin) and neuron (low-, medium- and high molecular weight neurofilament subunits: NF-L, NF-M and NF-H); increased mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (Erk and p38MAPK) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activities. Also, reactive astrogliosis takes part of the early responses to the insult with (PhTe)(2), evidenced by upregulated GFAP in Western blot, PCR and immunofluorescence analysis. Six days after (PhTe)(2) injection we found persistent astrogliosis, increased propidium iodide (PI) positive cells in NeuN positive population evidenced by flow cytometry and reduced immunofluorescence for NeuN, suggesting that the in vivo exposure to (PhTe)(2) progressed to neuronal death. Moreover, activated caspase 3 suggested apoptotic neuronal death. Neurodegeneration was related with decreased [(3)H]glutamate uptake and decreased Akt immunoreactivity, however phospho-GSK-3-beta (Ser9) was not altered in (PhTe)(2) injected rat. Therefore, the present results show that the earlier cerebellar responses to (PhTe)(2) include disruption of cytoskeletal homeostasis that could be related with MAPK and PKA activation and reactive astrogliosis. Akt inhibition observed at this time could also play a role in the neuronal death evidenced afterwards. The later events of the neurodegenerative process are characterized by persistent astrogliosis and activation of apoptotic neuronal death through caspase 3 mediated mechanisms, which could be related with glutamate excitotoxicity. The progression of these responses are therefore likely to be critical for the outcome of the neurodegeneration provoked by (PhTe)(2) in rat cerebellum.

23183084|t|Progestin effects on expression of AKR1C1-AKR1C3, SRD5A1 and PGR in the Z-12 endometriotic epithelial cell line.
23183084|a|Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterine cavity. This disease is associated with diminished protective effects of progesterone, which are usually explained by inadequate activation of progesterone receptors and also enhanced pre-receptor metabolism of progesterone. Endometriosis is often treated with progestins, which act as progesterone receptor agonists, although their exact mechanisms of action are not completely understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate how the progestins medroxyprogesterone acetate, dydrogesterone and dienogest, as well as progesterone, impact on the expression of genes of pre-receptor progesterone metabolism in Z-12 epithelial cell line, a model system of peritoneal endometriosis. Our data demonstrate that these progestins affect local pre-receptor metabolism to a different extent. The most favorable effects were seen for dydrogesterone and dienogest, where the first, dydrogesterone, significantly reduced SRD5A1, AKR1C2 and AKR1C3 expression, and additionally had a nonsignificant impact on progesterone receptor B (PR-B) protein levels. This might slow down the first step of pre-receptor metabolism, the conversion of progesterone to 5alpha-dihydroprogestrone by SRD5A1, and it might also affect further reduction of 3-keto and 20-keto groups catalyzed by AKR1C2 and AKR1C3. Similarly favorable effects were seen for dienogest, which promoted significant reduction of AKR1C1 and AKR1C2 expression and also showed no effect on PR-B protein levels. Different effects were seen for progesterone, which significantly decreased SRD5A1, PR-B and HSD17B2 protein levels. In contrast, treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate resulted in increased AKR1C1 expression and decreased levels of PR-B, which might lead to enhanced progesterone metabolism and reduced signaling through progesterone receptors. Altogether, our data in this Z-12 cell model suggest that the beneficial effects of treatment with progestin observed in endometriosis patients might arise from decreased pre-receptor metabolism of the protective progesterone by the SRD5A1 and AKR1C enzymes.

23200901|t|The role of efflux transporters on the transport of highly toxic aconitine, mesaconitine, hypaconitine, and their hydrolysates, as determined in cultured Caco-2 and transfected MDCKII cells.
23200901|a|Aconitum alkaloids including aconitine (AC), mesaconitine (MA), hypaconitine (HA), are highly toxic. Their hydrolysates, such as benzoylaconine (BAC), benzoylmesaconine (BMA), benzoylhypaconine (BHA), aconine, and mesaconine, are considerably less toxic. Efflux transporters, including P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and multidrug resistance-associated protein isoform 2 (MRP2), act as a first line of defence and play key roles in toxicity prevention. The aim of the present study was to determine the role of efflux transporters in the transport of Aconitum alkaloids using cultured Caco-2, MDR1-MDCKII and BCRP-MDCKII cells. Bidirectional transport assays of the Aconitum alkaloids were performed with or without P-gp (cyclosporine A and verapamil), BCRP (Ko143) and MRP2 (MK571) inhibitors. The efflux ratios (Er) of AC, MA, and HA in Caco-2 cells were 34.6+-4.2, 29.7+-2.1, and 15.6+-2.1, respectively; those of BAC, BMA, and BHA were approximately 4, and those of aconine and mesaconine were equal to 1. The Er values of AC, MA, and HA in MDR1-MDCKII and BCRP-MDCKII cells were significantly higher than those in parental MDCKII cells. Taken together the results of Er values and intracellular amounts in the presence of inhibitors, P-gp and BCRP were involved in the transport of AC, MA and HA; and MRP2 might transport AC, MA, HA, BAC, BMA and BHA.

23201927|t|Cardioprotective effect of salvianolic acid B against arsenic trioxide-induced injury in cardiac H9c2 cells via the PI3K/Akt signal pathway.
23201927|a|The clinical use of arsenic trioxide (ATO), a potent anti-neoplastic agent, is often limited because of its severe cardiotoxicity. Salviae miltiorrhiza is widely used for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. One of the most abundant ingredients of S. miltiorrhiza is salvianolic acid B (Sal B). The present study was designed to evaluate whether Sal B protects against ATO-induced cardiac cell injury in vitro. With MTT cell viability assay, LDH release, ROS generation, caspase-3 activity assay and Hoechst 33342/PI staining, we found that Sal B pretreatment provided significantly protection against ATO-induced cell death. The effect was correlated with the activation of the PI3K/Akt signal pathway. Conversely, blocking Akt activation with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 effectively suppressed the protective effect of Sal B against ATO-induced cell apoptosis. In addition, the PI3K inhibitor partially blocked the effects of Sal B on the upregulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl protein expression, and downregulation of Bax protein expression. Collectively, the results showed that Sal B decreased the apoptosis and necrosis of H9c2 cardiomyocytes caused by ATO treatment, and PI3K played a crucial role in enhancing cell survival during this process. These observations indicate that Sal B has the potential to exert cardioprotective effects against ATO toxicity.

23208609|t|Endocrine-disrupting effects of thioxanthone photoinitiators.
23208609|a|Photoinitiators used in food packaging ink, such as 2-isopropylthioxanthone (2-ITX), have been shown to migrate into food and beverages. Recently, several studies indicated that 2-ITX might be an endocrine-disrupting chemical. In this work, the effects of 2-ITX, 4-isopropylthioxanthone (4-ITX), 2,4-diethylthio xanthone (2,4-diethyl-TX), 2-chlorothioxanthone (2-chloro-TX), and 1-chloro-4-propoxythioxanthone (1-chloro-4-propoxy-TX) on steroidogenesis and androgen and estrogen receptor-mediated transcription activation have been studied using human H295R adrenocarcinoma cells and yeast hormone bioassays, respectively. None of the compounds showed androgenic or estrogenic activities, but clear antiandrogenic and antiestrogenic activities were observed for 2-ITX, 4-ITX, and 2,4-diethyl-TX, whereas 2-chloro-TX showed only antiandrogenic activity. In an adapted version of the H295R steroidogenesis assay, using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of H295R media, all five compounds increased levels of 17ss-estradiol and estrone. H295R cells incubated with 2-ITX also showed significantly reduced androgen and increased pregnenolone and progesterone levels. Expression of particular steroidogenic genes, including the one encoding for aromatase (CYP19A1), was significantly upregulated after incubation of H295R cells with 2-ITX, 4-ITX, and 2,4-diethyl-TX. In line with the increased CYP19A1 mRNA expression, 2-ITX increased catalytic activity of aromatase in H295R cells as measured by cognate aromatase assays. The results indicate that thioxanthone derivatives can act as potential endocrine disruptors both at the level of nuclear receptor signaling and steroid hormone production.

23220037|t|Doxorubicin decreases paraquat accumulation and toxicity in Caco-2 cells.
23220037|a|P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is an efflux pump belonging to the ATP-binding cassette transporter superfamily expressed in several organs. Considering its potential protective effects, the induction of de novo synthesis of P-gp could be used therapeutically in the treatment of intoxications by its substrates. The herbicide paraquat (PQ) is a P-gp substrate responsible for thousands of fatal intoxications worldwide that still lacks an effective antidote. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the effectiveness of such an antidote by testing whether doxorubicin (DOX), a known P-gp inducer, could efficiently protect Caco-2 cells against PQ cytotoxicity, 6 h after the incubation with the herbicide, reflecting a real-life intoxication scenario. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by the MTT assay and PQ intracellular concentrations were measured by gas chromatography-ion trap-mass spectrometry (GC-IT-MS). Also, the DOX modulatory effect on choline uptake transport system was assessed by measuring the uptake of [3H]-choline. The results show that DOX exerts protective effects against PQ cytotoxicity, preventing the intracellular accumulation of the herbicide. These protective effects were not completely prevented by the incubation with the UIC2 antibody, a specific P-gp inhibitor, suggesting the involvement of alternative protection mechanisms. In fact, DOX also efficiently inhibited the choline transport system that influences PQ cellular uptake. In conclusion, in this cellular model, DOX effectively protects against PQ toxicity by inducing P-gp and through the interaction with the choline transporter, suggesting that compounds presenting this double feature of promoting the efflux and limiting the uptake of PQ could be used as effective antidotes to treat intoxications.

23220562|t|Attenuated expression of the tight junction proteins is involved in clopidogrel-induced gastric injury through p38 MAPK activation.
23220562|a|Bleeding complications and delayed healing of gastric ulcer associated with use of clopidogrel is a common clinical concern; however, the underlying mechanisms remain to be determined. This study aimed to clarify whether clopidogrel could cause the damage of the human gastric epithelial cells and to further elucidate the mechanisms involved. After human gastric epithelial cell line GES-1 had been treated with clopidogrel (0.5-2.5 mM), the cell proliferation was examined by MTT assay, apoptosis was measured with DAPI staining and flow cytometry analysis, and the barrier function of the tight junctions (TJ) was evaluated by permeability measurement and transmission electron microscopy. Moreover, expression of the TJ proteins occludin and ZO-1 and the phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) p38, ERK, and JNK were examined by western blot. In addition, three MAPK inhibitors specific to p38, ERK and JNK were used, respectively, to verify the signaling pathways responsible for regulating the expression of the TJ proteins being tested. Results showed that clopidogrel significantly increased dextran permeability, induced apoptosis, suppressed GES-1 cell viability, and reduced the expression of the TJ proteins (occludin and ZO-1), acting through p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Furthermore, these observed effects were partially abolished by SB-203580 (a p38 MAPK inhibitor), rather than by either U-0126 (an ERK inhibitor) or SP-600125 (a JNK inhibitor), suggesting that clopidogrel-induced disruption in the gastric epithelial cells is mediated by the p38 MAPK pathway. It is concluded that attenuated expression of the TJ proteins occludin and ZO-1 in human gastric epithelial cells could be involved in clopidogrel-induced gastric mucosal injury through activation of the p38 MAPK pathway.

23220590|t|Inhibition of human alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases by cimetidine and assessment of its effects on ethanol metabolism.
23220590|a|Previous studies have reported that cimetidine, an H2-receptor antagonist used to treat gastric and duodenal ulcers, can inhibit alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) and ethanol metabolism. Human alcohol dehydrogenases and aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs), the principal enzymes responsible for metabolism of ethanol, are complex enzyme families that exhibit functional polymorphisms among ethnic groups and distinct tissue distributions. We investigated the inhibition by cimetidine of alcohol oxidation by recombinant human ADH1A, ADH1B1, ADH1B2, ADH1B3, ADH1C1, ADH1C2, ADH2, and ADH4, and aldehyde oxidation by ALDH1A1 and ALDH2 at pH 7.5 and a cytosolic NAD(+) concentration. Cimetidine acted as competitive or noncompetitive inhibitors for the ADH and ALDH isozymes/allozymes with near mM inhibition constants. The metabolic interactions between cimetidine and ethanol/acetaldehyde were assessed by computer simulation using the inhibition equations and the determined kinetic constants. At therapeutic drug levels (0.015 mM) and physiologically relevant concentrations of ethanol (10 mM) and acetaldehyde (10 muM) in target tissues, cimetidine could weakly inhibit (&lt;5%) the activities of ADH1B2 and ADH1B3 in liver, ADH2 in liver and small intestine, ADH4 in stomach, and ALDH1A1 in the three tissues, but not significantly affect ADH1A, ADH1B1, ADH1C1/2, or ALDH2. At higher drug levels, which may accumulate in cells (0.2 mM), the activities of the weakly-inhibited enzymes may be decreased more significantly. The quantitative effects of cimetidine on metabolism of ethanol and other physiological substrates of ADHs need further investigation.

23220609|t|The estrogenic effects of benzylparaben at low doses based on uterotrophic assay in immature SD rats.
23220609|a|Benzylparaben (BzP), a type of parabens being used as a preservative agent in cosmetics, food, and pharmaceutical products, may be ingested by humans. In this study, we performed an immature uterotrophic assay using Sprague Dawley (SD) rats by intragastric administration to determine the estrogenic effects of BzP and found significant increases in uterine weight with doses of 0.16 mg/kg body weight and higher (P&lt;0.05). The in vivo estrogenicity of BzP was supported by in vitro results from the human estrogen receptor alpha (hERalpha)-coactivator recruiting assay and in silico molecular docking analysis performed in this study. The in vitro estrogenic activity of BzP can be observed at concentrations of 1.0x10(-8) M and higher. Molecular docking analysis showed that BzP fits well into the agonist pocket of hERalpha. The lowest observed effect dose (LOED) (0.16 mg/kg/day) of BzP is much lower than the documented LOEDs of other parabens. Actual risk may exist for people who consume a diet high in BzP or use BzP-laden cosmetics. In addition, we tested the sensitivity of Wistar rats to 17beta-estradiol by immature uterotrophic assay, and no obvious uterotrophic response was observed in the rats given doses up to 100 mug/kg body weight.

23221006|t|Role of organic cation/carnitine transporter 1 in uptake of phenformin and inhibitory effect on complex I respiration in mitochondria.
23221006|a|Phenformin causes lactic acidosis in clinical situations due to inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I. It is reportedly taken up by hepatocytes and exhibits mitochondrial toxicity in the liver. In this study, uptake of phenformin and [(14)C]tetraethylammonium (TEA) and complex I inhibition by phenformin were examined in isolated liver and heart mitochondria. Uptake of phenformin into isolated rat liver mitochondria was higher than that into heart mitochondria. It was inhibited by several cat ionic compounds, which suggests the involvement of multispecific transport system(s). Similar characteristics were also observed for uptake of TEA; however, uptake of phenformin into mitochondria of organic cation/carnitine transporter 1 (OCTN1) knockout mice was lower than that in wild-type mice, whereas uptake of TEA was comparable between the two strains, suggesting the involvement of distinct transport mechanisms for these two cations in mitochondria. Inhibition by phenformin of oxygen consumption via complex I respiration in isolated rat liver mitochondria was greater than that in heart mitochondria, whereas inhibitory effect of phenformin on complex I respiration was similar in inside-out structured submitochondrial particles prepared from rat livers and hearts. Lactic acidosis provoked by iv infusion of phenformin was weaker in octn1(-/-) mice than that in wild-type mice. These observations suggest that uptake of phenformin into liver mitochondria is at least partly mediated by OCTN1 and functionally relevant to its inhibition potential of complex I respiration. This study was, thus, the first to demonstrate OCTN1-mediated mitochondrial transport and toxicity of biguanide in vivo in rodents.

23231502|t|Peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerase A1 (Pin1) is a target for modification by lipid electrophiles.
23231502|a|Oxidation of membrane phospholipids is associated with inflammation, neurodegenerative disease, and cancer. Oxyradical damage to phospholipids results in the production of reactive aldehydes that adduct proteins and modulate their function. 4-Hydroxynonenal (HNE), a common product of oxidative damage to lipids, adducts proteins at exposed Cys, His, or Lys residues. Here, we demonstrate that peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerase A1 (Pin1), an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of the peptide bond of pSer/pThr-Pro moieties in signaling proteins from cis to trans, is highly susceptible to HNE modification. Incubation of purified Pin1 with HNE followed by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry resulted in detection of Michael adducts at the active site residues His-157 and Cys-113. Time and concentration dependencies indicate that Cys-113 is the primary site of HNE modification. Pin1 was adducted in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells treated with 8-alkynyl-HNE as judged by click chemistry conjugation with biotin followed by streptavidin-based pulldown and Western blotting with anti-Pin1 antibody. Furthermore, orbitrap MS data support the adduction of Cys-113 in the Pin1 active site upon HNE treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells. siRNA knockdown of Pin1 in MDA-MB-231 cells partially protected the cells from HNE-induced toxicity. Recent studies indicate that Pin1 is an important molecular target for the chemopreventive effects of green tea polyphenols. The present study establishes that it is also a target for electrophilic modification by products of lipid peroxidation.

23237828|t|Cycloheximide stimulates suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 gene expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes via the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway.
23237828|a|Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-3 can act as a regulator of energy metabolism and cytokine signaling in fat cells. It is regulated by hormones and toxicological factors. However, the action of cycloheximide on expression of adipocyte SOCS-3 gene is unknown. Using 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we found that cycloheximide up-regulated SOCS-3 mRNA expression in dose- and time-dependent manners. Treatment with actinomycin D prevented cycloheximide-stimulated SOCS-3 mRNA expression, suggesting that the effect of cycloheximide requires new mRNA synthesis. While cycloheximide was shown to increase activities of MEK1 and JNK, signaling was demonstrated to be inhibited by pretreatment with either MEK1 inhibitors U0126 and PD98059, or with the JNK inhibitor SP600125. U0126 and PD98059, respectively, reduced cycloheximide-stimulated SOCS-3 mRNA expression, but SP600125 did not antagonize cycloheximide effect. Moreover, cycloheximide was observed to up-regulate expression of other SOCS family members, such as SOCS-1, -2, -4, -5, -6, -7, and cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein (CIS)-1 mRNAs. Such effects varied with the dosage and duration of cycloheximide treatment. These results imply the functional MEK1/ERK-mediated pathway is necessary for the cycloheximide stimulation of SOCS-3 gene expression.

23246481|t|Wogonin inhibits H2O2-induced vascular permeability through suppressing the phosphorylation of caveolin-1.
23246481|a|Wogonin, a naturally occurring monoflavonoid extracted from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, has been reported for its anti-oxidant activity. However, it is still unclear whether wogonin can inhibit oxidant-induced vascular permeability. In this study, we evaluated the effects of wogonin on H2O2-induced vascular permeability in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We found that wogonin can suppress the H2O2-stimulated actin remodeling and albumin uptake of HUVECs, as well as transendothelial cell migration of the human breast carcinoma cell MDA-MB-231. The mechanism revealed that wogonin inhibited H2O2-induced phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (cav-1) associating with the suppression of stabilization of VE-cadherin and beta-catenin. Moreover, wogonin repressed anisomycin-induced phosphorylation of p38, cav-1 and vascular permeability. These results suggested that wogonin could inhibit H2O2-induced vascular permeability by downregulating the phosphorylation of cav-1, and that it might have a therapeutic potential for the diseases associated with the development of both oxidant and vascular permeability.

23247009|t|Beta-glucogallin reduces the expression of lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory markers by inhibition of aldose reductase in murine macrophages and ocular tissues.
23247009|a|Aldose reductase (AR) catalyzes the reduction of toxic lipid aldehydes to their alcohol products and mediates inflammatory signals triggered by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Beta-glucogallin (BGG), a recently described AR inhibitor, was purified from extracts of the Indian gooseberry (Emblica officinalis). In this study, we found that BGG showed low cytotoxicity in Raw264.7 murine macrophages and effectively inhibited AR activity as measured by a decrease in sorbitol accumulation. In addition, BGG-mediated inhibition of AR prevented LPS-induced activation of JNK and p38 and lowered ROS levels, which could inhibit LPS-induced apoptosis. Uveitis is a disease of the eye associated with chronic inflammation. In this study, we also demonstrated that treatment with BGG decreased the number of inflammatory cells that infiltrate the ocular media of mice with experimental uveitis. Accordingly, these results suggest BGG is a potential therapy for inflammatory diseases.

23247010|t|Regulation of human carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1, SDR21C1) gene by transcription factor Nrf2.
23247010|a|Monomeric carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1, SDR21C1) is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily and is involved in the metabolism of anthracycline anti-cancer drugs, prostaglandins, and isatin, which is an endogenous inhibitor of monoamine oxidases. Additionally, cancer progression may be partly regulated by CBR1. In the present study, we screened more than 10 drugs for the induction of the human CBR1 gene to investigate its regulation. Of the drugs, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) was found to be an inducer. BHA induced the mRNA and protein expression of CBR1 in hepatoma HepG2 cells. In a luciferase reporter gene assay, the promoter region between -2062 bp and the transcription start site of CBR1 was also activated by BHA. The transcription factor Nrf2 is known to be activated by BHA. There are 2 anti-oxidant responsive elements (ARE) that are bound by Nrf2 in this region. Mutation analyses revealed that one of the AREs participates in the gene regulation of CBR1 by Nrf2. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that Nrf2 binds the site. Moreover, to determine whether the functional ARE of CBR1 is conserved with the promoter region of homologues in other species, the nucleotide sequences of the functional AREs of the Chcr1 and Chcr2 genes, which are the Chinese hamster homologues of CBR1, were determined. The region has 2 AREs, and these genes were also induced by the forced expression of Nrf2 (cotransfection of pNrf2) in the luciferase reporter gene assay. In conclusion, Nrf2 is a novel transcriptional regulator of CBR1 genes in humans and the Chinese hamster. Because the regulation of CBR1 appears to be important for diseases, the induction of CBR1 by Nrf2 may be a therapeutic target.

23261589|t|Salsolinol induced apoptotic changes in neural stem cells: amelioration by neurotrophin support.
23261589|a|Salsolinol (SAL), a catechol isoquinoline has invited considerable attention due to its structural similarity with dopaminergic neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Its high endogenous presence in Parkinsonian brain implicated its possible association with the disease process. SAL is also present in alcohol beverages and certain food materials and can get access to brain especially in conditions of immature or impaired BBB. Besides this, the effect of SAL on neural stem cells (NSCs) which are potential candidates for adult neurogenesis and transplantation mediated rejuvenating attempts for Parkinson's disease (PD) brain has not been known so far. NSCs in both the cases have to overcome suppressive cues of diseased brain for their survival and function. In this study we explored the toxicity of SAL toward NSCs focusing on apoptosis and status of PI3K survival signaling. NSCs cultured from embryonic day 11 rat fetal brain including those differentiated to TH(+ve) colonies, when challenged with SAL (1-100muM), elicited a concentration and time dependent cell death/loss of mitochondrial viability. 10muM SAL on which significant mitochondrial impairment initiated was further used to study mechanism of toxicity. Morphological impairment, enhanced TUNEL positivity, cleaved caspase-3 and decreased Bcl-2:Bax suggested apoptosis. Sal toxicity coincided with reduced pAkt level and its downstream effectors: pCREB, pGSK-3beta, Bcl-2 and neurotrophins GDNF, BDNF suggesting repressed PI3K/Akt signaling. Multiple neurotrophic factor support in the form of Olfactory Ensheathing Cell's Conditioned Media (OEC CM) potentially protected NSCs against SAL through activating PI3K/Akt pathway. This was confirmed on adding LY294002 the PI3K inhibitor which abolished the protection. We inferred that SAL exerts substantial toxicity toward NSCs. These findings will lead to better understanding of endogenous threats that might affect the fate of transplanted NSCs and their probable antidotes.

23261645|t|The effects of jaspamide on human cardiomyocyte function and cardiac ion channel activity.
23261645|a|Jaspamide (jasplakinolide; NSC-613009) is a cyclodepsipeptide that has antitumor activity. A narrow margin of safety was observed between doses required for efficacy in mouse tumor models and doses that caused severe acute toxicity in rats and dogs. We explored the hypothesis that the observed toxicity was due to cardiotoxicity. Jaspamide was tested in a patch clamp assay to determine its effect on selected cardiac ion channels. Jaspamide (10 muM) inhibited Kv1.5 activity by 98.5%. Jaspamide also inhibited other channels including Cav1.2, Cav3.2, and HCN2; however, the Kv11.1 (hERG) channel was minimally affected. Using spontaneously contracting human cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, effects on cardiomyocyte contraction and viability were also examined. Jaspamide (30 nM to 30 muM) decreased cardiomyocyte cell indices and beat amplitude, putative measurements of cell viability and cardiac contractility, respectively. Concentration-dependent increases in rhythmic beating rate were noted at &lt;= 6 h of treatment, followed by dose-dependent decreases after 6 and 72 h exposure. The toxic effects of jaspamide were compared with that of the known cardiotoxicant mitoxantrone, and confirmed by multiparameter fluorescence imaging analysis. These results support the hypothesis that the toxicity observed in rats and dogs is due to toxic effects of jaspamide on cardiomyocytes.

23261676|t|(-) Epicatechin attenuates mitochondrial damage by enhancing mitochondrial multi-marker enzymes, adenosine triphosphate and lowering calcium in isoproterenol induced myocardial infarcted rats.
23261676|a|Cardiac mitochondrial damage plays an important role in the pathology of myocardial infarction. The protective effects of (-) epicatechin on cardiac mitochondrial damage in isoproterenol induced myocardial infarction were evaluated in rats. Rats were pretreated with (-) epicatechin (20 mg/kg body weight) daily for a period of 21 days. After the pretreatment period, isoproterenol (100 mg/kg body weight) was injected subcutaneously into rats twice at an interval of 24 h to induce myocardial infarction. Isoproterenol induced myocardial infarcted rats showed a significant increase in the levels of cardiac diagnostic markers, heart mitochondrial lipid peroxidation, calcium, and a significant decrease in the activities/levels of heart mitochondrial glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, reduced glutathione, isocitrate, succinate, malate, alpha-ketoglutarate and NADH-dehydrogenases, cytochrome-C-oxidase and adenosine triphosphate. (-) Epicatechin pretreatment showed significant protective effects on all the biochemical parameters evaluated. The in vitro study revealed the superoxide and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity of (-) epicatechin. The possible mechanisms for the beneficial effects of (-) epicatechin on cardiac mitochondria could be attributed to scavenging of free radicals, decreasing calcium, increasing multi-enzymes (antioxidant, tricarboxylic acid cycle and respiratory chain enzymes), reduced glutathione and adenosine triphosphate. Thus, (-) epicatechin attenuated mitochondrial damage in isoproterenol induced myocardial infarcted rats.

23261715|t|Modulation of activity and inhibitor sensitivity of rabbit aldose reductase-like protein (AKR1B19) by oxidized glutathione and SH-reagents.
23261715|a|Rabbit aldo-keto reductase (AKR) 1B19 is an ortholog of human aldose reductase-like protein (ARLP), AKR1B10, showing 86% amino acid sequence identity. AKR1B19 exhibits the highest catalytic efficiency for 4-oxo-2-nonenal, a major product of lipid peroxidation, compared to known reductases of this aldehyde. In this study, we found that the reductase activity of AKR1B19 was activated to about 5-fold immediately after the addition of 10 muM SH-reagents (p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid and p-chloromercuribenzoic acid) in the absence or presence of NADPH. In addition, a maximum of 3-fold activation of AKR1B19 was induced by incubation with glutathione disulfide (GSSG) for 1h. The activated enzyme was converted into the native enzyme by further incubation with dithiothreitol and glutathione. The activation was abolished by the C299S mutation of AKR1B19, and the glutathionylated Cys299 was identified by mass spectrometry analysis. The Cys299-modified enzyme displayed different kinetic alterations depending on substrates and inhibitors. In the reduction of 4-oxo-2-nonenal, the catalytic efficiency was increased. Thus, AKR1B10 may be modulated by cellular ratio of GSSG/glutathione and more efficiently act as a detoxifying enzyme for the cytotoxic aldehyde under oxidatively stressed conditions. Furthermore, such an activity alteration by GSSG was not detected in AKR1B10 and rat ARLPs, suggesting the presence of a GSSG-binding site near Cys299 in AKR1B19.

23261757|t|Increased urinary excretion of albumin, hemopexin, transferrin and VDBP correlates with chronic sensitization to gentamicin nephrotoxicity in rats.
23261757|a|Drug nephrotoxicity is a serious health and economic problem worldwide. Rats can be acutely sensitized to acute kidney injury (AKI) by subnephrotoxic treatments with potentially nephrotoxic drugs. Acquired sensitization to AKI poses a silent risk impossible to diagnose pre-emptively with the technology available at the clinical level. Herein, we hypothesized whether a chronic, subnephrotoxic insult to the kidneys might result in chronically acquired sensitization to AKI, and whether chronic sensitization might be detected through specific urinary markers. To this end, rats were treated with a subtoxic dosage of the experimental nephrotoxin uranyl nitrate (UN) in the drinking water for 21 weeks, or plain water (as control), and then with low-dose gentamicin for 7 days. Renal function and renal tissue damage were evaluated through the experiment. The mild renal damage caused by gentamicin was markedly magnified in rats having received UN chronically, which was evident both at the functional and histological level. Four proteins, namely albumin, hemopexin, transferrin and vitamin D binding protein were increased in the urine in temporal association with the appearance of chronic predisposition. Although further studies are necessary, our results suggest that these proteins might be potentially used as markers of hidden, chronic predisposition to gentamicin nephrotoxicity, in order to appropriately and pre-emptively stratify and handle individuals according to their specific risk in the long term, and to conveniently optimize their life conditions or additional clinical procedures or treatments that might trigger the disease. This might reduce AKI incidence and severity and the associated costs.

23266269|t|Protective effect of ganodermanondiol isolated from the Lingzhi mushroom against tert-butyl hydroperoxide-induced hepatotoxicity through Nrf2-mediated antioxidant enzymes.
23266269|a|Ganodermanondiol, a biologically active compound, was isolated from the Lingzhi mushroom (Ganoderma lucidum). The present study examined the protective effects of ganodermanondiol against tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP)-induced hepatotoxicity. Ganodermanondiol protected human liver-derived HepG2 cells through nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway-dependent heme oxygenase-1 expressions. Moreover, ganodermanondiol increased cellular glutathione levels and the expression of the glutamine-cysteine ligase gene in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, ganodermanondiol exposure enhanced the phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its upstream kinase activators, LKB1 and Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-II (CaMKII). This study indicates that ganodermanondiol exhibits potent cytoprotective effects on t-BHP-induced hepatotoxicity in human liver-derived HepG2 cells, presumably through Nrf2-mediated antioxidant enzymes and AMPK.

23270704|t|Apocynin and raisanberine alleviate intermittent hypoxia induced abnormal StAR and 3beta-HSD and low testosterone by suppressing endoplasmic reticulum stress and activated p66Shc in rat testes.
23270704|a|We hypothesized that hypoxia induced testicular damage is mediated by an activated NADPH oxidase (NOX), therefore, APO (apocynin) an inhibitor of NOX and raisanberine (RS), a calcium influx inhibitor were tested if they could attenuate hypoxic toxicity to the testis. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to hypoxia (10+-0.5% O2) for 17d and intervened with APO and RS in the last 6d. Histological changes and expression of pro-inflammation factors were evaluated in vivo. Biomarkers in isolated Leydig cells incubated with H2O2 were also assayed in vitro. Hypoxic rats displayed lower serum testosterone and higher LH and FSH. Upregulation of p22/p47(phox), NOX2, MMP9, PERK and p66Shc was associated with downregulation of StAR, 3beta-HSD and Cx43 in the hypoxia testis, revealed by Western blot and immunohistochemical assay, respectively. APO and RS at least partially normalize hypoxia caused male hypogonadism by suppressing ER stress, and p66Shc in testes.

23271742|t|Arsenic suppresses cell survival via Pirh2-mediated proteasomal degradation of DeltaNp63 protein.
23271742|a|Transcription factor p63, a member of the p53 family, shares a high degree of sequence similarity with p53. Because of transcription from two distinct promoters, the p63 gene encodes two isoforms, TAp63 and DeltaNp63. Although TAp63 acts as a tumor suppressor, DeltaNp63 functions as an oncogene and is often overexpressed in squamous cell carcinomas. Thus, therapeutic agents targeting DeltaNp63 might be used to manage tumors that overexpress DeltaNp63. Here we found that arsenic trioxide, a frontline agent for acute promyelocytic leukemia, inhibits DeltaNp63 but not TAp63 expression in time- and dose-dependent manners. In addition, we found that arsenic trioxide decreases the stability of DeltaNp63 protein via a proteasome-dependent pathway but has little effect on the level of DeltaNp63 transcript. Furthermore, we found that arsenic trioxide activates the Pirh2 promoter and consequently induces Pirh2 expression. Consistent with this, we found that knockdown of Pirh2 inhibits, whereas ectopic expression of Pirh2 enhances, arsenic-induced degradation of DeltaNp63 protein. Importantly, we found that knockdown of DeltaNp63 sensitizes, whereas ectopic expression of DeltaNp63 inhibits, growth suppression induced by arsenic. Together, these data suggest that arsenic degrades DeltaNp63 protein at least in part via Pirh2-dependent proteolysis and that inhibition of DeltaNp63 expression facilitates tumor cells to arsenic-induced death.

23273999|t|Michaelis-Menten kinetic analysis of drugs of abuse to estimate their affinity to human P-glycoprotein.
23273999|a|The pharmacokinetics of various important drugs are known to be significantly influenced by the human ABC transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may lead to clinically relevant drug-drug interactions. In contrast to therapeutic drugs, emerging drugs of abuse (DOA) are sold and consumed without any safety pharmacology testing. Only some studies on their metabolism were published, but none about their affinity to the transporter systems. Therefore, 47 DOAs from various classes were tested for their P-gp affinity using human P-gp (hP-gp) to predict possible drug-drug interactions. DOAs were initially screened for general hP-gp affinity and further characterized by modeling classic Michaelis-Menten kinetics and assessing their K(m) and V(max) values. Among the tested drugs, 12 showed a stimulation of ATPase activity. The most intensive stimulating DOAs were further investigated and compared with the known P-gp model substrates sertraline and verapamil. ATPase stimulation kinetics could be modeled for the entactogen 3,4-methylenedioxy-alpha-ethylphenethylamine (3,4-BDB), the hallucinogen 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI), the abused alkaloid glaucine, the opioid-like drugs N-iso-propyl-1,2-diphenylethylamine (NPDPA), and N-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)-3-ethoxypropanamine (PCEPA), with K(m) and V(max) values within the same range as for verapamil or sertraline. As a consequence interactions with other drugs being P-gp substrates might be considered to be very likely and further studies should be encouraged.

23274770|a|CYP450 enzymes are key determinants in drug toxicities, reduced pharmacological effect and adverse drug reactions. Mitragynine, an euphoric compound was evaluated for its effects on the expression of mRNAs encoding CYP1A2, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 and protein expression and resultant enzymatic activity. The mRNA and protein expression of CYP450 isoforms were carried out using an optimized multiplex qRT-PCR assay and Western blot analysis. CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 enzyme activities were evaluated using P450-Glo  assays. The effects of mitragynine on human CYP3A4 protein expression were determined using an optimized hCYP3A4-HepG2 cell-based assay. An in silico computational method to predict the binding conformation of mitragynine to the active site of the CYP3A4 enzyme was performed and further validated using in vitro CYP3A4 inhibition assays. Mitragynine was found to induce mRNA and protein expression of CYP1A2. For the highest concentration of 25 muM, induction of mRNA was approximately 70% that of the positive control and was consistent with the increased CYP1A2 enzymatic activity. Thus, mitragynine is a significant in vitro CYP1A2 inducer. However, it appeared to be a weak CYP3A4 inducer at the transcriptional level and a weak CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitor. It is therefore, unlikely to have any significant clinical effects on CYP3A4 activity.

23287708|t|Sunset yellow FCF, a permitted food dye, alters functional responses of splenocytes at non-cytotoxic dose.
23287708|a|Sunset yellow FCF (SY), a permitted food color, is extensively used in various food preparations and quite often exceeds the permissible levels (100-200 mg/kg). Several toxicity studies on SY are reported, however immunomodulatory properties have not been explored yet. To investigate the immunotoxic properties of SY, splenocytes were isolated, cultured and subjected to mitogen stimulated proliferation assay (lipopolysaccharide, LPS or concanavalin A, Con A), mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assay, immunophenotypic analysis of cell surface receptor expression and assay for cytokines release in the culture supernatants were performed in the presence of SY. Since SY did not exhibit any cytotoxicity up to 250 mug/ml, this dose was used for further studies. It was observed that SY (250 mug/ml) significantly (p&lt;0.05) suppressed the mitogen induced proliferation of splenocytes and MLR response. Further, immunophenotypic analysis revealed that SY alters the relative expression of CD3e/CD4/CD8 in T cells and CD19 in B-cells. Consistent with the suppression of T-cell and B-cell responses and altered surface receptor expression, SY also lowered the expression of IL2, IL4, IL6, IL-17, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha cytokines. These results suggest that non-cytotoxic dose of SY may have immunomodulatory effects.

23287710|t|Dose dependent molecular effects of acrylamide and glycidamide in human cancer cell lines and human primary hepatocytes.
23287710|a|Recently published studies suggest a weak positive correlation between increased dietary acrylamide intake and the increased risk of endometrial and ovarian cancer. However, risk assessment of acrylamide remains difficult because the carcinogenic mechanisms are still unknown and in particular the molecular effects of low level acrylamide exposure as seen by dietary intake are not well understood. Therefore, we analyzed in ovarian and endometrial cancer cell lines as well as in primary hepatocytes the expression of genes involved in cancer development and xenobiotic metabolism after high and low dose exposure (1-0.001mM) of acrylamide and its metabolite glycidamide. In conclusion our in vitro results demonstrate that exposure to high doses of glycidamide/acrylamide - exceeding the dietary exposure of the general population by far - can induce genes with growth promoting potential like the oncogene cMYC and genes involved in the MAPK pathway. However, low-dose exposure seems to activate primarily genes involved in the elimination of the toxicant.

23288052|t|Molecular mechanisms of fibrosis-associated promotion of liver carcinogenesis.
23288052|a|Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mostly develops in patients with advanced fibrosis; however, the mechanisms of interaction between a genotoxic insult and fibrogenesis are not well understood. This study tested a hypothesis that fibrosis promotes HCC via a mechanism that involves activation of liver stem cells. First, B6C3F1 mice were administered diethylnitrosamine (DEN; single ip injection of 1mg/kg at 14 days of age). Second, carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4); 0.2ml/kg, 2/week ip starting at 8 weeks of age) was administered for 9 or 14 weeks to develop advanced liver fibrosis. In animals treated with DEN as neonates, presence of liver fibrosis led to more than doubling (to 100%) of the liver tumor incidence as early as 5 months of age. This effect was associated with activation of cells with progenitor features in noncancerous liver tissue, including markers of replicative senescence (p16), oncofetal transformation (Afp, H19, and Bex1), and increased "stemness" (Prom1 and Epcam). In contrast, the dose of DEN used did not modify the extent of liver inflammation, fibrogenesis, oxidative stress, proliferation, or apoptosis induced by subchronic CCl(4) administration. This study demonstrates the potential role of liver stem-like cells in the mechanisms of chemical-induced, fibrosis-promoted HCC. We posit that the combination of genotoxic and fibrogenic insults is a sensible approach to model liver carcinogenesis in experimental animals. These results may contribute to identification of cirrhotic patients predisposed to HCC by analyzing the expression of hepatic progenitor cell markers in the noncancerous liver tissue.

23288144|t|Sunitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, induces cytochrome P450 1A1 gene in human breast cancer MCF7 cells through ligand-independent aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation.
23288144|a|Sunitinib (SUN) is a new multi-targeted oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has both anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activities. However, information reported in the literature on the effects of SUN on the constitutive expression of cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) gene in cells from mammalian species remains unclear. Therefore, the main objectives of the current work were to investigate the potentiality of SUN to induce CYP1A1 gene expression in human breast cancer MCF7 cells and to explore the molecular mechanisms involved. Our results showed that SUN induced the CYP1A1 mRNA, protein, and activity levels in a concentration-dependent manner in MCF7 cells. The increase in CYP1A1 mRNA by SUN was completely blocked by the transcriptional inhibitor, actinomycin D; implying that SUN increased de novo RNA synthesis. Furthermore, the ability of SUN to increase luciferase reporter gene expression suggests an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-dependent transcriptional control and excludes the possibility of any posttranscriptional mechanisms. In addition, blocking of AhR activation by resveratrol, a well-known AhR antagonist, prevented the SUN-induced CYP1A1 gene expression, further confirms the involvement of AhR. Interestingly, this was associated with the inability of SUN to directly bind to and induce transformation of cytosolic AhR to its DNA-binding form in vitro, suggesting that the effect of SUN does not involve direct binding to AhR. The current manuscript provides the first evidence for the ability of SUN to induce CYP1A1 gene expression in MCF7 cells through AhR ligand-independent mechanisms.

23291559|t|Nuclear receptor CAR specifically activates the two-pore K+ channel Kcnk1 gene in male mouse livers, which attenuates phenobarbital-induced hepatic hyperplasia.
23291559|a|KCNK1, a member of the family of two-pore K(+) ion channels, is specifically induced in the livers of male mice after phenobarbital treatment. Here, we have determined the molecular mechanism of this male-specific activation of the Kcnk1 gene and characterized KCNK1 as a phenobarbital-inducible antihyperplasia factor. Upon activation by phenobarbital, nuclear receptor CAR binds the 97-bp response element (-2441/-2345) within the Kcnk1 promoter. This binding is observed in the livers of male mice, but not in the livers of female mice and requires the pituitary gland, because hypophysectomy abrogates it. Hyperplasia further progressed in the livers of Kcnk1  (  -/-  ) male mice compared with those of Kcnk1  (  +/+  ) males after phenobarbital treatment. Thus, KCNK1 suppresses phenobarbital-induced hyperplasia. These results indicate that phenobarbital treatment induces KCNK1 to elicit a male-specific and growth-suppressing signal. Thus, KCNK1 and Kcnk1  (  -/-  ) mice provide an experimental tool for further investigation into the molecular mechanism of CAR-mediated promotion of the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in mice.

23295224|t|Biocatalytic production of alpha-hydroxy ketones and vicinal diols by yeast and human aldo-keto reductases.
23295224|a|The alpha-hydroxy ketones are used as building blocks for compounds of pharmaceutical interest (such as antidepressants, HIV-protease inhibitors and antitumorals). They can be obtained by the action of enzymes or whole cells on selected substrates, such as diketones. We have studied the enantiospecificities of several fungal (AKR3C1, AKR5F and AKR5G) and human (AKR1B1 and AKR1B10) aldo-keto reductases in the production of alpha-hydroxy ketones and diols from vicinal diketones. The reactions have been carried out with pure enzymes and with an NADPH-regenerating system consisting of glucose-6-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. To ascertain the regio and stereoselectivity of the reduction reactions catalyzed by the AKRs, we have separated and characterized the reaction products by means of a gas chromatograph equipped with a chiral column and coupled to a mass spectrometer as a detector. According to the regioselectivity and stereoselectivity, the AKRs studied can be divided in two groups: one of them showed preference for the reduction of the proximal keto group, resulting in the S-enantiomer of the corresponding alpha-hydroxy ketones. The other group favored the reduction of the distal keto group and yielded the corresponding R-enantiomer. Three of the AKRs used (AKR1B1, AKR1B10 and AKR3C1) could produce 2,3-butanediol from acetoin. We have explored the structure/function relationships in the reactivity between several yeast and human AKRs and various diketones and acetoin. In addition, we have demonstrated the utility of these AKRs in the synthesis of selected alpha-hydroxy ketones and diols.

23295227|t|X-ray structure of the V301L aldo-keto reductase 1B10 complexed with NADP(+) and the potent aldose reductase inhibitor fidarestat: implications for inhibitor binding and selectivity.
23295227|a|Only one crystal structure is currently available for tumor marker AKR1B10, complexed with NADP(+) and tolrestat, which is an aldose reductase inhibitor (ARI) of the carboxylic acid type. Here, the X-ray structure of the complex of the V301L substituted AKR1B10 holoenzyme with fidarestat, an ARI of the cyclic imide type, was obtained at 1.60A resolution by replacement soaking of crystals containing tolrestat. Previously, fidarestat was found to be safe in phase III trials for diabetic neuropathy and, consistent with its low in vivo side effects, was highly selective for aldose reductase (AR or AKR1B1) versus aldehyde reductase (AKR1A1). Now, inhibition studies showed that fidarestat was indeed 1300-fold more selective for AR as compared to AKR1B10, while the change of Val to Leu (found in AR) caused a 20-fold decrease in the IC50 value with fidarestat. Structural analysis of the V301L AKR1B10-fidarestat complex displayed enzyme-inhibitor interactions similar to those of the AR-fidarestat complex. However, a close inspection of both the new crystal structure and a computer model of the wild-type AKR1B10 complex with fidarestat revealed subtle changes that could affect fidarestat binding. In the crystal structure, a significant motion of loop A was observed between AR and V301L AKR1B10, linked to a Phe-122/Phe-123 side chain displacement. This was due to the presence of the more voluminous Gln-303 side chain (Ser-302 in AR) and of a water molecule buried in a subpocket located at the base of flexible loop A. In the wild-type AKR1B10 model, a short contact was predicted between the Val-301 side chain and fidarestat, but would not be present in AR or in V301L AKR1B10. Overall, these changes could contribute to the difference in inhibitory potency of fidarestat between AR and AKR1B10.

23295229|t|Fluorescence lifetime analysis and effect of magnesium ions on binding of NADH to human aldehyde dehydrogenase 1.
23295229|a|Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1A1) catalyzes the oxidation of toxic aldehydes to carboxylic acids. Physiologic levels of Mg(2+) ions decrease ALDH1 activity in part by increasing NADH binding affinity to the enzyme. By using time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, we have resolved the fluorescent lifetimes (tau) of free NADH in solution (tau=0.4 ns) and two enzyme-bound NADH states (tau=2.0 ns and tau=7.7 ns). We used this technique to investigate the effects of Mg(2+) ions on the ALDH1A1-NADH binding characteristics and enzyme catalysis. From the resolved free and bound NADH fluorescence signatures, the KD values for both NADH conformations in ALDH1A1 ranged from about 24 muM to 1 muM for Mg(2+) ion concentrations of 0-6000 muM, respectively. The rate constants for dissociation of the enzyme-NADH complex ranged from 0.03 s(-1) (6000 muM Mg(2+)) to 0.30s(-1) (0 muM Mg(2+)) as determined by addition of excess NAD(+) to prevent re-association of NADH and resolving the real-time NADH fluorescence signal. During the initial reaction of enzyme with NAD(+) and butyraldehyde, there was an immediate rise in the NADH fluorescence, due to the formation of bound NADH complexes, with a constant steady-state rate of production of free NADH. As the Mg(2+) ion concentration was increased, there was a consistent decrease of the enzyme catalytic turnover from 0.31 s(-1) (0 muM Mg(2+)) to 0.050 s(-1) (6000 muM Mg(2+)) and a distinct shift in steady-state conformational population from one that favors the ALDH1-NADH complex with the shorter fluorescence lifetime (33% excess) in the absence of magnesium ion to one that favors the ALDH1-NADH complex with the longer fluorescence lifetime (13% excess) at 6000 muM Mg(2+). This shift in conformational population at higher Mg(2+) ion concentrations and to lower enzyme activity may be due to longer residence time of the NADH in the ALDH1 pocket. The results from monitoring enzyme catalysis in the absence of magnesium suggests that the ALDH1-NADH complex with the shorter fluorescence lifetime is the form initially produced, and the complex with the longer fluorescence lifetime is produced through isomerization.

23296102|t|Acrolein induces Alzheimer's disease-like pathologies in vitro and in vivo.
23296102|a|The pathologic mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have not been fully uncovered. Acrolein, a ubiquitous dietary pollutant and by-product of oxidative stress, can induce cytotoxicity in neurons, which might play an important role in the etiology of AD. Here, we examined the effects of Acrolein on the AD pathologies in vitro and in vivo. We found Acrolein induced HT22 cells death in concentration- and time-dependent manners. Interestingly, Acrolein increased proteins' levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP), beta-secretase (BACE-1) and the amyloid beta-peptide transporter receptor for advanced glycation end products, and decreased A-disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) 10 levels. In vivo, chronic oral exposure to Acrolein (2.5 mg/kg/day by intragastric gavage for 8 weeks) induced mild cognitive declination and pyknosis/atrophy of hippocampal neurons. The activity of superoxide dismutase was down-regulated while the level of malondialdehyde was up-regulated in rat brain. Moreover, Acrolein resulted in activation of astrocytes, up-regulation of BACE-1 in cortex and down-regulation of ADAM-10 in hippocampus and cortex. Taken together, our findings suggest that exposure to Acrolein induces AD-like pathology in vitro and in vivo. Scavenging Acrolein might be beneficial for the therapy of AD.

23297412|t|Resveratrol improves cardiomyopathy in dystrophin-deficient mice through SIRT1 protein-mediated modulation of p300 protein.
23297412|a|Cardiomyopathy is the main cause of death in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Here, we show that oral administration of resveratrol, which leads to activation of an NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase SIRT1, suppresses cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis and restores cardiac diastolic function in dystrophin-deficient mdx mice. The pro-hypertrophic co-activator p300 protein but not p300 mRNA was up-regulated in the mdx heart, and resveratrol administration down-regulated the p300 protein level. In cultured cardiomyocytes, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by the alpha(1)-agonist phenylephrine was inhibited by the overexpression of SIRT1 as well as resveratrol, both of which down-regulated p300 protein levels but not p300 mRNA levels. In addition, activation of atrial natriuretic peptide promoter by p300 was inhibited by SIRT1. We found that SIRT1 induced p300 down-regulation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by deacetylation of lysine residues for ubiquitination. These findings indicate the pathological significance of p300 up-regulation in the dystrophic heart and indicate that SIRT1 activation has therapeutic potential for dystrophic cardiomyopathy.

23313376|t|Pterostilbene exerts antitumor activity against human osteosarcoma cells by inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.
23313376|a|Osteosarcoma is a high-grade malignant bone tumor. Pterostilbene (PTE) is a natural, dimethylated analog of resveratrol with higher bioavailability. While PTE has been shown to have potent antitumor activity against various types of cancer, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of PTE remain largely unknown. The Janus kinase 2/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis and immune development. In this study, we assessed the antitumor activity of PTE against human osteosarcoma cells and explored the role of JAK2/STAT3 and apoptosis-related signaling pathways on the activity of PTE. PTE treatment resulted in a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of osteosarcoma cell viability. Additionally, PTE exhibited strong antitumor activity, as evidenced not only by reductions in tumor cell adhesion, migration and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) but also by increases in the apoptotic index, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and several biochemical parameters. Furthermore, PTE treatment directly inhibited the phosphorylation of JAK2 at Tyr 1007 and the downstream activation of STAT3. PTE also down-regulated the expression of STAT3 target genes, including the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, leading to the up-regulation of mitochondrial apoptosis pathway-related proteins (Bax, Bak, cytosolic Cytochrome c, and cleaved Caspase3) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as p21 and p27. PTE, used in combination with a known JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor, AG490, further decreased the viability of osteosarcoma cells. Taken together, PTE is a potent inhibitor of osteosarcoma cell growth that targets the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. These data suggest that inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 signaling is a novel mechanism of action for PTE during therapeutic intervention in osteosarcoma cancers.

23313730|t|The effect of manganese on dopamine toxicity and dopamine transporter (DAT) in control and DAT transfected HEK cells.
23313730|a|Chronic exposure to Mn results in the development of a neurological disorder known as manganism characterized by neurological deficits resembling that seen in Parkinsonism. Although dopaminergic neurons within the nigrostriatal pathway appear intact, Mn-induced irregularities in DA transmission have been observed including decreased amphetamine-induced DA release and loss of the dopamine transporter (DAT). Results of studies to evaluate the effect of Mn and DA on cell viability in control and DAT-transfected HEK cells reveal that Mn is equally toxic to both cell lines whereas DA was only toxic to cells containing DAT. DA toxicity was saturable suggesting that transport may be rate limiting. When Mn and DA were added simultaneously to the media, cell toxicity was similar to that produced by Mn alone suggesting that Mn may suppress DA uptake in the DAT containing cells. Preincubation of DA prior to the addition of Mn resulted in cell death which was essentially additive with that produced independently by the two agents. Mn was also shown to decrease DA uptake and amphetamine-induced DA efflux in DAT containing cells. Time-lapsed confocal microscopy indicates that Mn can promote trafficking of cell surface DAT into intracellular compartments which may account for the decrease in DA uptake and DA efflux in these cells. Mn-induced internalization of DAT may provide an explanation for disruption in DA transmission previously reported in the striatum.

23313794|t|Effects of 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo [4, 5-b] pyridine (PhIP) on histopathology, oxidative stress, and expression of c-fos, c-jun and p16 in rat stomachs.
23313794|a|2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo [4, 5-b] pyridine (PhIP) is one of the most abundant heterocyclic amines (HCAs) generated from overcooking meat at high temperatures. To understand the possible mechanism of PhIP-associated stomach cancer, the effects of PhIP on morphology, oxidative stress, gene expression of c-fos, c-jun and p16 in rat stomachs were investigated. The results showed that (1) 15mg/kg body weight PhIP induced obvious histopathological changes in gastric mucosa; (2) PhIP (10 and/or 15mg/kg) significantly decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathioneperoxidase (GPx) activities, while increased catalase (CAT) activity compared with the control. With the elevated doses of PhIP, malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, protein carbonyl (PCO) contents and DNA-protein crosslinks (DPC) coefficients were significantly raised in a dose-dependent manner; (3) PhIP at the doses of 10mg/kg and/or 15mg/kg significantly inhibited p16 mRNA and protein expression, whereas enhanced c-fos and c-jun expression relative to control. The data indicated that PhIP could cause stomach injury, oxidative stress in rat stomachs as well as the activation of c-fos and c-jun and inactivation of p16, which may play a role in the pathogenesis of PhIP-associated stomach cancer.

23318726|t|Butein protects human dental pulp cells from hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative toxicity via Nrf2 pathway-dependent heme oxygenase-1 expressions.
23318726|a|Rhus verniciflua Stokes is a plant that is native to East Asian countries, such as Korea, China, and Japan. Butein, a plant polyphenol, is one of the major active components of R. verniciflua. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), produced via dental adhesive bleaching agents and pulpal disease, can cause oxidative stress. Here, we found that butein possesses cytoprotective effects on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced dental cell death. H2O2 is a representative ROS and causes cell death through necrosis in human dental pulp (HDP) cells. H2O2-induced cytotoxicity and production of ROS were blocked in the presence of butein, and these effects were dose dependent. Butein also increased heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein expression and HO activity. In addition, butein-dependent HO-1 expression was required for the inhibition of H2O2-induced cell death and ROS generation. Furthermore, butein treatment caused nuclear accumulation of nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and increased the promoter activity of antioxidant response elements (AREs). Treatment of HDP cells with a c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor also reduced butein-induced HO-1 expression, and butein treatment led to increased JNK phosphorylation. These results indicate that butein may be used to prevent functional dental cell death and thus may be useful as a pulpal disease agent.

23318731|t|Oxidative and nitrosative stress and apoptosis in oral mucosa cells after ex vivo exposure to lead and benzo[a]pyrene.
23318731|a|Exposure of human oral mucosa to lead (Pb) and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) by inhalation and ingestion can lead to pathological conditions via apoptosis and oxidative and nitrosative stress. However, few studies have investigated the effects of Pb and BaP on oral mucosa cells. Furthermore, previous studies focused on chronic Pb and BaP exposure. Therefore, we evaluated important markers of apoptosis and oxidative and nitrosative stress in oral mucosa cells by incubating the cells with Pb and BaP for 5-360 min. Ex vivo samples of human oral mucosa were exposed to Pb or BaP, and immunohistochemical staining was performed to evaluate active caspase-3, 8-epi-prostaglandin F2 alpha (8-epi-PGF2a), and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT). Pb and BaP treatments significantly increased active caspase-3 levels in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, the treatments induced an early increase in 3-NT level, which ceased with longer incubation times. 8-Epi-PGF2a level increased only after prolonged incubation with Pb, and this elevation was irrespective of BaP incubation duration. Smokers' samples had significantly lower levels of markers of oxidative and nitrosative stress than did nonsmokers' samples. Thus, single, short-term exposure to Pb or BaP increases the levels of apoptosis markers and markers of oxidative and nitrosative stress.

23333640|t|The inhibition of HIF-2alpha on the ATM/Chk-2 pathway is involved in the promotion effect of arsenite on benzo(a)pyrene-induced cell transformation.
23333640|a|Both arsenite and benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) are known human carcinogens. Studies on the mode-of-action of arsenite indicate that it can also act as co-carcinogen or as a cancer promoter, and that it can facilitate progression of cancers. Some studies on development of lung cancers have suggested a synergism between arsenite exposure and cigarette smoking. The mechanism of action for such an effect, however, remains obscure. In the present study, we investigated the effects of HIF-2alpha on arsenite- and BaP-induced cell malignant transformation as well as on signal transduction pathways in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells. The results show that arsenite accelerates the neoplastic transformation and migration of cells and enhances chromosomal aberrations induced by BaP. HIF-2alpha is involved in blocking the effects of arsenite in activating the ATM/Chk-2 pathway and in repair of DNA damage induced by BaP. Moreover, blocking of HIF-2alpha prevents the effects of arsenite on the neoplastic transformation, cell migration, and chromosomal aberrations caused by BaP. These results indicate that the repressive effect of HIF-2alpha on the ATM/Chk-2 pathway leads to genomic instability, which is involved in arsenite-accelerated, BaP-induced malignant transformation of HBE cells.

23337567|t|Osteoblasts survive the arsenic trioxide treatment by activation of ATM-mediated pathway.
23337567|a|Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is widely used in tumor treatment, but excessive arsenic exposure can have adverse effects. We recently found that, in primary osteoblasts, ATO produces oxidative stress and causes DNA tailing, but does not induce apoptosis. We further examined the signaling pathway by which osteoblasts survive ATO treatment, and found that they were arrested at G2/M phase of the cell cycle at 30h and overrode the G2/M boundary at 48h. After treatment for 30h, there was increased Cdc2 phosphorylation and expression of Wee1, a Cdc2 kinase, and expression of the cell cycle inhibitor, p21(waf1/cip1), which interacts with Cdc2. Furthermore, levels of the phosphatase Cdc25C, which activates Cdc2, were decreased, while the ratio of its phosphorylated/inactivated form to the total amount was increased. Moreover, phosphorylation/activation of the checkpoint kinases Chk1, Chk2 and p53 levels were increased, as were levels of activated ATM and gamma-H2AX. The cell viability was decreased as an ATM inhibitor was added. Additionally, these effects of ATO on gamma-H2AX, Chk1, Chk2, p53, and p21(waf1/cip1) were reduced by an ATM inhibitor. These findings suggest that G2/M phase arrest of osteoblasts is mediated by Chk1/Chk2 activation via an ATM-dependent pathway by which osteoblasts survive.

23339663|t|Inhibition pathways of the potent organophosphate CBDP with cholinesterases revealed by X-ray crystallographic snapshots and mass spectrometry.
23339663|a|Tri-o-cresyl-phosphate (TOCP) is a common additive in jet engine lubricants and hydraulic fluids suspected to have a role in aerotoxic syndrome in humans. TOCP is metabolized to cresyl saligenin phosphate (CBDP), a potent irreversible inhibitor of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), a natural bioscavenger present in the bloodstream, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the off-switch at cholinergic synapses. Mechanistic details of cholinesterase (ChE) inhibition have, however, remained elusive. Also, the inhibition of AChE by CBDP is unexpected, from a structural standpoint, i.e., considering the narrowness of AChE active site and the bulkiness of CBDP. In the following, we report on kinetic X-ray crystallography experiments that provided 2.7-3.3 A snapshots of the reaction of CBDP with mouse AChE and human BChE. The series of crystallographic snapshots reveals that AChE and BChE react with the opposite enantiomers and that an induced-fit rearrangement of Phe297 enlarges the active site of AChE upon CBDP binding. Mass spectrometry analysis of aging in either H(2)(16)O or H(2)(18)O furthermore allowed us to identify the inhibition steps, in which water molecules are involved, thus providing insights into the mechanistic details of inhibition. X-ray crystallography and mass spectrometry show the formation of an aged end product formed in both AChE and BChE that cannot be reactivated by current oxime-based therapeutics.

23348408|t|Anti-inflammatory activity of patchouli alcohol in RAW264.7 and HT-29 cells.
23348408|a|Patchouli alcohol (PA) is a chemical compound extracted from patchouli which belongs to the genus Pogostemon, herb of mint family. Recently, it has been reported that PA inhibits the production of inflammatory mediators. However, the biological mechanisms of PA for anti-inflammatory activities have not been studied. In this study, we investigated whether PA decreases the production of inflammatory mediators through downregulation of the NF-kappaB and ERK pathway. Our data indicated that PA inhibits the over-expression of iNOS and IL-6 in protein and mRNA levels in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 and TNF-alpha stimulated HT-29 cells. PA inhibited IkappaB-alpha degradation and p65 nuclear translocation, and subsequently suppressed transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 and TNF-alpha-stimulated HT-29 cells. In addition, PA inhibited LPS- or TNF-alpha-stimulated ERK1/2 activation by decreasing phosphorylation of ERK1/2. These findings suggest that PA shows anti-inflammatory activities through suppressing ERK-mediated NF-kappaB pathway in mouse macrophage and human colorectal cancer cells.

23353026|t|Oxidative stress involvement in manganese-induced alpha-synuclein oligomerization in organotypic brain slice cultures.
23353026|a|Overexposure to manganese (Mn) has been known to induce neuronal damage. However, little is known of the role that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play in protein aggregation resulting from Mn exposure. The current study investigated whether oxidative stress is involved in manganese-induced alpha-synuclein oligomerization in organotypic brain slices. After application of Mn (0-400muM) for 24h, there was a dose-dependent increase in average percentage of propidium iodide positive (PI(+)) nuclei in slices and levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the culture medium. Moreover, the treatment with Mn resulted in a dose-dependent increase in neurocyte apoptosis, ROS level, and decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Mn also caused oxidative damage in cell lipid and protein. At the same time, the exposure of Mn leaded to significantly increase in the expression of alpha-synuclein mRNA and protein. Alpha-synuclein oligomerization occurred in Mn-treated slices, especially on membrane-bound form. It indicated that alpha-synuclein oligomers were more likely to combination cell membranes and resulting in membrane damage. Mn-induced neurocyte damage and alpha-synuclein oligomerization were also partially alleviated by the pretreatment with GSH and aggravated by H2O2 pretreatment. The findings revealed Mn might exert its neurotoxic effects by oxidative stress-mediated alpha-synuclein oligomerization in organotypic brain slices.

23353698|t|ABT-737 resistance in B-cells isolated from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients and leukemia cell lines is overcome by the pleiotropic kinase inhibitor quercetin through Mcl-1 down-regulation.
23353698|a|Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most frequent form of leukemia in adult population and despite numerous studies, it is considered an incurable disease. Since CLL is characterized by overexpression of pro-survival Bcl-2 family members, treatments with their antagonists, such as ABT-737, represent a promising new therapeutic strategy. ABT-737 is a BH3 mimetic agent which binds Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Bcl-w with high affinity, while weakly interacts with Mcl-1 and Bfl-1. Previous studies demonstrated that quercetin, a flavonoid naturally present in food and beverages, was able to sensitize B-cells isolated from CLL patients to apoptosis when associated with death ligands or fludarabine, through a mechanism involving Mcl-1 down-regulation. Here, we report that the association between ABT-737 and quercetin synergistically induces apoptosis in B-cells and in five leukemic cell lines (Combination Index &lt;1). Peripheral blood mononuclear cell from healthy donors were not affected by quercetin treatment. The molecular pathways triggered by quercetin have been investigated in HPB-ALL cells, characterized by the highest resistance to both ABT-737 and quercetin when applied as single molecules, but highly sensitivity to the co-treatment. In this cell line, quercetin down-regulated Mcl-1 through the inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, leading to Mcl-1 instability. The same mechanism was confirmed in B-cells. These results may open new clinical perspectives based on a translational approach in CLL therapy.

23370008|t|Serum amyloid A upsurge precedes standard biomarkers of hepatotoxicity in ritodrine-injected mice.
23370008|a|The tocolytic agent ritodrine acts on the beta2-adrenoceptor and is an effective treatment option for preterm labor. However, several adverse effects of ritodrine therapy, including liver damage, have been noted. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of ritodrine-induced adverse effects, development of sensitive biomarkers of these adverse events is necessary. Here, we report the development and analysis of an animal model of ritodrine-induced liver damage. Female mice received daily ritodrine injections for 2 weeks; liver samples were then collected and subjected to DNA microarray analysis. Ritodrine significantly altered the expression of genes related to steroid and lipid metabolism, as well as the metabolism of ritodrine itself. Importantly, expression of the acute-phase reactant serum amyloid A (SAA) significantly increased after ritodrine injection, with values indicating the largest fold-change. This large increase in blood SAA levels serves as a more sensitive biomarker than conventional liver enzymes, such as aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. The increase in SAA expression is specific to ritodrine-induced liver damage, because SAA expression was not induced by other hepatotoxic drugs such as acetaminophen, valproic acid, or metformin. Our in vitro studies showed that cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation was not a primary cause of the ritodrine-induced SAA increase. Instead, SAA expression was enhanced by indirect phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) mediated by interleukin-6. Therefore, our study provides a method for sensitive and early detection of hepatic injury, and may thus help preclude serious liver damage due to ritodrine use in preterm labor.

23376140|t|Hepatocytes display a compensatory survival response against cadmium toxicity by a mechanism mediated by EGFR and Src.
23376140|a|Although the liver is a cadmium-target organ, hepatocyte response involved in its toxicity is not yet elucidated. A link between this heavy metal treatment and Stat3 signaling pathways was examined in primary mouse hepatocytes. We provided evidence of a novel link among NADPH oxidase and Stat3 signaling, mediated by Src, EGFR, and Erk1/2. Cadmium activates NADPH oxidase. ROS produced by this oxidase activates Src, enable that in turn, transactivates EGFR that activates Stat3 in tyrosine, allowing its dimerization. Also, ROS from NADPH oxidase favors ERK1/2 activation that phosphorylates Stat3 in serine, resulting in a compensatory or adaptive survival response such as production of metallothionein-II in short Cd exposure times. However, after 12h CdCl2 treatment, cell viability diminished in 50%, accompanied by a drastic decrease of metallothionein-II production, and an increase in p53 activation and the pro-apoptotic protein Bax.

For this purpose, markers of bone formation (osteocalcin, procollagen I, osteoprotegerin, alkaline phosphatase) and resorption (telopeptides of collagen I, soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand), calciotropic hormones (parathormone, calcitonin, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) in the serum, and the femur content of mineral (including calcium - Ca and inorganic phosphorus - P(i)) and organic components were estimated in the rats exposed to 500 mg Pb/l (in drinking water) or/and Et (5 g/kg b.wt./24 h, by oral gavage) for 12 weeks. Moreover, Ca and P(i) in the serum and urine, alkaline phosphatase in the bone tissue and Pb in the blood and femur were determined. The exposure to Pb or/and Et decreased bone formation and increased its resorption resulting in the bone demineralization. These effects were accompanied by destroying the hormonal regulation of mineral metabolism, and Ca and P(i) imbalance. The co-exposure to Pb and Et-induced disorders in bone metabolism were more advanced than those caused by Pb alone. Et co-administration increased Pb concentration in the blood and decreased its accumulation in the bone. This paper is the first report providing evidence that consumption of Et under exposure to Pb intensifies disorders in bone metabolism and that destroying of the receptor activator nuclear factor-kappaB (RANK)/RANK ligand/osteoprotegerin system is involved in the mechanisms of interactive action of these xenobiotics on the skeleton. The modifying impact of Et may be an effect of its independent osteotropic action and interaction with Pb. Based on the results it can be concluded that alcohol abuse by subjects excessively exposed to Pb considerably increases the risk of bone damage.

23376438|t|Cellular mechanisms of the cytotoxic effects of the zearalenone metabolites alpha-zearalenol and beta-zearalenol on RAW264.7 macrophages.
23376438|a|Zearalenone (ZEN) and its metabolites are commonly found in many food commodities and are known to cause reproductive disorders and genotoxic effects. The major ZEN metabolites are alpha-zearalenol (alpha-ZOL) and beta-zearalenol (beta-ZOL). Although many studies have demonstrated the cytotoxic effects of these metabolites, the mechanisms by which alpha-ZOL or beta-ZOL mediates their cytotoxic effects appear to differ according to cell type and the exposed toxins. We evaluated the toxicity of alpha-ZOL and beta-ZOL on RAW264.7 macrophages and investigated the underlying mechanisms. beta-ZOL not only more strongly reduced the viability of cells than did alpha-ZOL, but it also induced cell death mainly by apoptosis rather than necrosis. The ZEN metabolites induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), mitochondrial changes in Bcl-2 and Bax proteins, and cytoplasmic release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Use of an inhibitor specific to c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 kinase or p53, but not pan-caspase or caspase-8, decreased the toxin-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and also attenuated the alpha-ZOL- or beta-ZOL-induced decrease of cell viability. Antioxidative enzyme or compounds such as catalase, acteoside, and (E)-1-(3,4-dihydroxyphenethyl)-3-(4-hydroxystyryl)urea suppressed the ZEN metabolite-mediated reduction of cell viability. Further, knockdown of AIF via siRNA transfection diminished the ZEN metabolite-induced cell death. Collectively, these results suggest that the activation of p53, JNK or p38 kinase by ZEN metabolites is the main upstream signal required for the mitochondrial alteration of Bcl-2/Bax signaling pathways and intracellular ROS generation, while MMP loss and nuclear translocation of AIF are the critical downstream events for ZEN metabolite-mediated apoptosis in macrophages.

23376440|t|Sodium arsenite induces cyclooxygenase-2 expression in human uroepithelial cells through MAPK pathway activation and reactive oxygen species induction.
23376440|a|Arsenic can induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to oxidative stress and carcinogenesis. Bladder is one of the major target organs of arsenic, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) may play an important role in arsenic-induced bladder cancer. However, the mechanism by which arsenic induces COX-2 in bladder cells remains unclear. This study aimed at investigating arsenic-mediated intracellular redox status and signaling cascades leading to COX-2 induction in human uroepithelial cells (SV-HUC-1). SV-HUC-1 cells were exposed to sodium arsenite and COX-2 expression, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation, glutathione (GSH) levels, ROS induction and Nrf2 expression were quantified. Our results demonstrate that arsenite (1-10 muM) elevates COX-2 expression, GSH levels, ROS and Nrf2 expression. Arsenite treatment for 24h stimulates phosphorylation of ERK and p38, but not JNK in SV-HUC-1 cells. Induction of Cox-2 mRNA levels by arsenite was attenuated by inhibitors of ERK, p38 and JNK. Arsenite-induced ROS generation and COX-2 expression were significantly attenuated by treatment with melatonin (a ROS scavenger), but enhanced by DL-buthionine-(S, R)-sulfoximine (BSO, an inhibitor of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS) resulting in lower GSH and increased ROS levels). These data indicate that arsenite promotes an induction of ROS, which results in an induction of COX-2 expression through activation of the MAPK pathway.

23377617|t|Decreased zinc availability affects glutathione metabolism in neuronal cells and in the developing brain.
23377617|a|A deficit in zinc (Zn) availability can increase cell oxidant production, affect the antioxidant defense system, and trigger oxidant-sensitive signals in neuronal cells. This work tested the hypothesis that a decreased Zn availability can affect glutathione (GSH) metabolism in the developing rat brain and in neuronal cells in culture, as well as the capacity of human neuroblastoma IMR-32 cells to upregulate GSH when challenged with dopamine (DA). GSH levels were low in the brain of gestation day 19 (GD19) fetuses from dams fed marginal Zn diets throughout gestation and in Zn-deficient IMR-32 cells. gamma-Glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCL), the first enzyme in the GSH synthetic pathway, was altered by Zn deficiency (ZD). The protein and mRNA levels of the GCL modifier (GCLM) and catalytic (GCLC) subunits were lower in the Zn-deficient GD19 fetal brain and in IMR-32 cells compared with controls. The nuclear translocation of transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2, which controls GCL transcription, was impaired by ZD. Posttranslationally, the caspase-3-dependent GCLC cleavage was high in Zn-deficient IMR-32 cells. Cells challenged with DA showed an increase in GCLM and GCLC protein and mRNA levels and a consequent increase in GSH concentration. Although Zn-deficient cells partially upregulated GCL subunits after exposure to DA, GSH content remained low. In summary, results show that a low Zn availability affects the GSH synthetic pathway in neuronal cells and fetal brain both at transcriptional and posttranslational levels. This can in part underlie the GSH depletion associated with ZD and the high sensitivity of Zn-deficient neurons to pro-oxidative stressors.

23380477|t|Autophagy takes place in mutated p53 neuroblastoma cells in response to hypoxia mimetic CoCl(2).
23380477|a|Solid tumors like neuroblastoma exhibit hypoxic areas, which can lead both to cell death or aggressiveness increase. Hypoxia is a known stress able to induce stabilization of p53, implicated in cell fate regulation. Recently, p53 appeared to be involved in autophagy in an opposite manner, depending on its location: when nuclear, it enhanced transcription of pro-autophagic genes whereas when cytoplasmic, it inhibited the autophagic process. Today, we used cobalt chloride, a hypoxia mimetic that inhibits proteasomal HIF-1 degradation and generates reactive oxygen species (ROS). We focused on CoCl2-induced cell death in a DNA-binding mutated p53 neuroblastoma cell line (SKNBE(2c)). An autophagic signaling was evidenced by an increase of Beclin-1, ATG 5-12, and LC3-II expression whereas the p53(mut) presence decreased with CoCl2 time exposure. Activation of the pathway seemed to protect cells from ROS production and, at least in part, from death. The autophagic inhibitors activated the apoptotic signaling and the death was enhanced. To delineate the eventual implication of the p53(mut) in the autophagic process in response to hypoxia, we monitored signaling in p53(WT)SHSY5Y cells, after either shRNA-p53 down-regulation or transcriptional activity inhibition by pifithrin alpha. We did not detect autophagy neither with p53(wt) nor when p53 was lacking whereas such a response was effective with a mutated or inactivated p53. To conclude, mutated p53 in neuroblastoma cells could be linked with the switch between apoptotic response and cell death by autophagy in response to hypoxic mimetic stress.

23384967|t|Comparative analysis of human CYP3A4 and rat CYP3A1 induction and relevant gene expression by bisphenol A and diethylstilbestrol: implications for toxicity testing paradigms.
23384967|a|Bisphenol A (BPA) and diethylstilbestrol (DES) are endocrine-disrupting chemicals that interact with the human pregnane X receptor (PXR). CYP3A4 enzyme is essential in the hydroxylation of steroid hormones and is regulated by PXR. In the present study, human and rat hepatoma cell lines were exposed to BPA and DES. Both BPA and DES (10-50muM) caused a significant activation of the CYP3A4 promoter via the PXR in the DPX2 human hepatoma cell line. No activation of rat PXR was seen. BPA and DES treated DPX2 cells demonstrated increased expression of CYP3A4 mRNA, and increased enzyme activity. In summary, BPA, in concentrations relevant to current safety levels of human exposure, activates the human PXR and demonstrates an increase in CYP3A4 mRNA expression and enzyme activity. BPA actions in this model system occur to a greater extent than DES. This study raises concerns regarding our current toxicity testing paradigms and species utilization.

23385219|t|Integrated analysis of transcriptomics and metabonomics profiles in aflatoxin B1-induced hepatotoxicity in rat.
23385219|a|The aim of this work was to identify mechanisms and potential biomarkers for predicting the development and progression of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)-induced acute hepatotoxicity. In this study, microarray analysis and metabolites profiles were used to identify shifts in gene expression and metabolite levels associated with the affected physiological processes of rats treated with AFB1. Histopathological examinations and serum biochemical analysis were simultaneously performed; the results indicated that hepatotoxicity occurred in higher dosage groups. However, gene expression analysis and metabolite profiles are more sensitive than general toxicity studies for detecting AFB1-induced acute hepatotoxicity as the patterns of low-dose AFB1-treated rats in these two technique platforms were more similar to the rats in higher dosage groups than to the control rats. Integrated analysis of the results from general toxicity studies, transcriptomics and metabonomics profiles suggested that p53 signaling pathway induced by oxidative damage was the crucial step in AFB1-induced acute hepatotoxicity, whereas gluconeogenesis and lipid metabolism disorder were found to be the major metabolic effects after acute AFB1 exposure. The genes and metabolites significantly affected in common in rat liver or serum of three doses AFB1 treatments served as potential biomarkers for detecting AFB1-induced acute hepatotoxicity.

23385959|t|Manganese-exposed developing rats display motor deficits and striatal oxidative stress that are reversed by Trolox.
23385959|a|While manganese (Mn) is essential for proper central nervous system (CNS) development, excessive Mn exposure may lead to neurotoxicity. Mn preferentially accumulates in the basal ganglia, and in adults it may cause Parkinson's disease-like disorder. Compared to adults, younger individuals accumulate greater Mn levels in the CNS and are more vulnerable to its toxicity. Moreover, the mechanisms mediating developmental Mn-induced neurotoxicity are not completely understood. The present study investigated the developmental neurotoxicity elicited by Mn exposure (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg; i.p.) from postnatal day 8 to PN27 in rats. Neurochemical analyses were carried out on PN29, with a particular focus on striatal alterations in intracellular signaling pathways (MAPKs, Akt and DARPP-32), oxidative stress generation and cell death. Motor alterations were evaluated later in life at 3, 4 or 5 weeks of age. Mn exposure (20 mg/kg) increased p38(MAPK) and Akt phosphorylation, but decreased DARPP-32-Thr-34 phosphorylation. Mn (10 and 20 mg/kg) increased caspase activity and F2-isoprostane production (a biological marker of lipid peroxidation). Paralleling the changes in striatal biochemical parameters, Mn (20 mg/kg) also caused motor impairment, evidenced by increased falling latency in the rotarod test, decreased distance traveled and motor speed in the open-field test. Notably, the antioxidant Trolox  reversed the Mn (20 mg/kg)-dependent augmentation in p38(MAPK) phosphorylation and reduced the Mn (20 mg/kg)-induced caspase activity and F2-isoprostane production. Trolox  also reversed the Mn-induced motor coordination deficits. These findings are the first to show that long-term exposure to Mn during a critical period of neurodevelopment causes motor coordination dysfunction with parallel increment in oxidative stress markers, p38(MAPK) phosphorylation and caspase activity in the striatum. Moreover, we establish Trolox  as a potential neuroprotective agent given its efficacy in reversing the Mn-induced neurodevelopmental effects.

23391485|t|Effect of low dose bisphenol A on the early differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into mammary epithelial cells.
23391485|a|It has been previously reported that bisphenol A (BPA) can disturb the development of mammary structure and increase the risk of breast cancer in experimental animals. In this study, an in vitro model of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) differentiation into mammary epithelial cells was applied to investigate the effect of low dose BPA on the early stages of mammogenesis. A newly established hESC line was directionally differentiated into mammary epithelial cells by a well-established three-dimensional (3D) culture system. The differentiated mammary epithelial cells were characterized by immunofluorescence and western blotting assay, and were called induced differentiated mammary epithelial cells (iDMECs) based on these data. The hESCs were treated with low doses of BPA range 10(-9)-10(-6)M during the differentiation process, with DMSO as the solvent control and 17-beta-estrodiol (E2) as the estrogen-positive control. Our results showed that low dose BPA and E2 could influence the mammosphere area of iDMECs and upregulate the expression level of Oct4 and Nanog proteins, while only BPA could downregulate the expression of E-cadherin protein. Taken together, this study provides some insights into the effects of low dose BPA on the early differentiation stage of mammary epithelial cells and suggests an easier canceration status of iDMECs under the effect of low dose BPA during its early differentiation stage.

23395669|t|Sophocarpine alleviates hepatocyte steatosis through activating AMPK signaling pathway.
23395669|a|Sophocarpine, an effective compound derived from foxtail-like sophora herb and seed, has been reported that it can alleviate non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in rats and affect adipocytokine synthesis. Meanwhile, adipocytokines could adjust hepatic lipid metabolism through AMPK signaling pathway. In the work presented here, primary hepatocytes were isolated from specific pathogen-free male SD rats and incubated with 200 mumol/L oleic acid for 24h to induce steatotic model, then treated with sophocarpine for 72 h. Oil red staining was performed to evaluate steatosis, total RNA and protein of primary hepatocytes were extracted for real-time RT-PCR and western blot analysis. A cluster of aberrances were observed in the model group, including hepatocyte steatosis, increased leptin and decreased adiponectin mRNA expressions. While sophocarpine treatment resulted in: significant improvement of steatosis (&gt;50% decrease), decrease of leptin expression (&lt;0.57-fold) and increase of adiponectin expression (&gt;1.48-fold). Moreover, compared with the model group, sophocarpine could significantly increase P-AMPKalpha (&gt;5.82-fold), AMPKalpha (&gt;1.29-fold) and ACC (&gt;3.27-fold) protein expressions, and reduce P-ACC (&lt;0.30-fold) and HNF-4alpha (&lt;0.20-fold) protein expression. The mRNA expression of Srebp-1c was downregulated significantly simultaneously (&lt;0.68-fold). We concluded that sophocarpine could alleviate hepatocyte steatosis and the potential mechanism might be the activated signaling pathway of AMPK.

23395717|t|Xestospongin C induces monocytic differentiation of HL60 cells through activation of the ERK pathway.
23395717|a|Xestospongin C (XC), which is a group of macrocyclic bis-1-oxaquinolizidines, is a potent inhibitor of sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium transport ATPase and IP3 receptor. Nevertheless, very less information is available regarding whether XC induces AML differentiation. We investigated the potential role of XC in the differentiation of human leukemia HL60 cells and mechanisms underlying XC actin. XC treatment inhibited proliferation by inducing G1-phase cell cycle arrest in the HL60 cells. In addition, XC induced differentiation of HL60 cells into the CD14(+) monocytic lineage, which was indicated by morphological changes, nitroblue tetrazolium reduction assay, and expressions of CD11b and CD14 surface antigens. Our results also showed that XC promotes phagocytic activity and granularity in HL60 cells, suggesting that the cells are functionally activated. Furthermore, XC enhanced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-mediated cytotoxic effect by increasing the numbers of TNF receptors. Moreover, we showed that XC activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway in the differentiation stages. Inhibition of ERK activation using PD98059 significantly decreased NBT+HL60 cells induced by XC treatment. Taken together, the results show that XC promotes monocytic differentiation of HL60 cells via ERK pathway activation, suggesting that XC could be a candidate for use as a differentiation-inducing agent for AML treatment.

23395825|t|Elevation of 4-hydroxynonenal and malondialdehyde modified protein levels in cerebral cortex with cognitive dysfunction in rats exposed to 1-bromopropane.
23395825|a|1-Bromopropane (1-BP), an alternative to ozone-depleting solvents (ODS), exhibits central nervous system (CNS) toxicity in animals and humans. This study was designed to relate CNS damage by Morris water maze (MWM) test and oxidative stress to 1-BP exposure in the rat. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 4 groups (n=10), and treated with 0, 200, 400 and 800 mg/kgbw 1-BP for consecutive 12 days, respectively. From day 8 to day 12 of the experiment, MWM test was employed to assess the cognitive function of rats. The cerebral cortex of rats was obtained immediately following the 24h after MWM test conclusion. Glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and total thiol (total-SH) content, GSH reductase (GR) and GSH peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities, malondialdehyde (MDA) level, as well as 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and MDA modified proteins in homogenates of cerebral cortex were measured. The obtained results showed that 1-BP led to cognitive dysfunction of rats, which was evidenced by delayed escape latency time and swimming distances in MWM performance. GSH and total-SH content, GSH/GSSG ratio, GR activity significantly decreased in cerebral cortex of rats, coupling with the increase of MDA level. 4-HNE and MDA modified protein levels obviously elevated after 1-BP exposure. GSH-Px activities in cerebral cortex of rats also increased. These data suggested that 1-BP resulted in enhanced lipid peroxidation of brain, which might play an important role in CNS damage induced by 1-BP.

23401472|t|Epigenetic regulation is a crucial factor in the repression of UGT1A1 expression in the human kidney.
23401472|a|Human uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 catalyzes the metabolism of numerous clinically and pharmacologically important compounds, such as bilirubin and SN-38. UGT1A1 is predominantly expressed in the liver and intestine but not in the kidney. The purpose of this study was to uncover the mechanism of the tissue-specific expression of UGT1A1, focusing on its epigenetic regulation. Bisulfite sequence analysis revealed that the CpG-rich region near the UGT1A1 promoter (-85 to +40) was hypermethylated (83%) in the kidney, whereas it was hypomethylated (37%) in the liver. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that histone H3 near the promoter was hypoacetylated in the kidney but hyperacetylated in the liver; this hyperacetylation was accompanied by the recruitment of hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 1alpha to the promoter. The UGT1A1 promoter in human kidney-derived HK-2 cells that do not express UGT1A1 was fully methylated, but this promoter was relatively unmethylated in human liver-derived HuH-7 cells that express UGT1A1. Treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), an inhibitor of DNA methylation, resulted in an increase of UGT1A1 mRNA expression in both cell types, but the increase was much larger in HK-2 cells than in HuH-7 cells. The transfection of an HNF1alpha expression plasmid into the HK-2 cells resulted in an increase of UGT1A1 mRNA only in the presence of 5-aza-dC. In summary, we found that DNA hypermethylation, along with histone hypoacetylation, interferes with the binding of HNF1alpha, resulting in the defective expression of UGT1A1 in the human kidney. Thus, epigenetic regulation is a crucial determinant of tissue-specific expression of UGT1A1.

23403272|t|Paeoniflorin protects human EA.hy926 endothelial cells against gamma-radiation induced oxidative injury by activating the NF-E2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase-1 pathway.
23403272|a|Pulmonary endothelial cells have been demonstrated to have a critical role in the pathogenesis of radiation-induced lung injury. Our preliminary experiments indicated that paeoniflorin protected human EA.hy926 endothelial cells from radiation-induced oxidative injury. This study was designed to confirm the protective effect of paeoniflorin against radiation-induced endothelial cellular damage and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Preincubation of EA.hy926 cells with paeoniflorin before gamma-radiation resulted in significant inhibition of apoptosis, a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and enhanced cell viability. In particular, we showed that paeoniflorin significantly reduced the formation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, and enhanced production of the endogenous antioxidants, glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in EA.hy926 cells. Treatment of these cells with paeoniflorin significantly induced HO-1 expression. Moreover, paeoniflorin promoted the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor-2 (Nrf-2). The paeoniflorin-induced HO-1 expression was abrogated by Nrf2 siRNA. Furthermore, inhibition of HO-1 with zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZNPP) significantly reversed the protective effect of paeoniflorin against radiation-induced damage in EA.hy926 cells. Our findings confirmed that paeoniflorin protected EA.hy926 cells against radiation-induced injury through the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.

23406025|t|In vitro polyphenolics erythrocyte model and in vivo chicken embryo model revealed gallic acid to be a potential hemorrhage inducer: physicochemical action mechanisms.
23406025|a|The in vivo chicken embryo model (CEM) demonstrated that gallic acid (GA) induced dysvascularization and hypoxia. Inflammatory edema, Zenker's necrosis, hemolysis, and liposis of cervical muscles were the common symptoms. Levels of the gene hif-1alpha, HIF-1alpha, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and NFkappaB in cervical muscles were all significantly upregulated, while the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was downregulated in a dose-responsive manner. Consequently, the cervical muscle inflammation and hemolysis could have been stimulated en route to the tissue TNF-alpha-canonical and the atypical pathways. We hypothesized that GA could deplete the dissolved oxygen (DO) at the expense of semiquinone and quinone formation, favoring the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production to induce RBC disruption and Fe(2+) ion release. To explore this, the in vitro polyphenolics-erythrocyte model (PEM) was established. PEM revealed that the DO was rapidly depleted, leading to the release of a huge amount of Fe (II) ions and hydrogen peroxide (HPO) in a two-phase kinetic pattern. The kinetic coefficients for Fe (II) ion release ranged from 0.347 h(-1) to 0.774 h(-1); and those for Fe (III) ion production were from 6.66 x 10(-3) h(-1) to 8.93 x 10(-3) h(-1). For phase I HPO production, they ranged from 0.236 h(-1) to 0.774 h(-1) and for phase II HPO production from 0.764 h(-1) to 2.560 h(-1) at GA within 6 muM to 14 muM. Thus, evidence obtained from PEM could strongly support the phenomena of CEM. To conclude, GA tends to elicit hypoxia-related inflammation and hemolysis in chicken cervical muscles through its extremely high prooxidant activity.

23419638|t|Pelargonidin activates the AhR and induces CYP1A1 in primary human hepatocytes and human cancer cell lines HepG2 and LS174T.
23419638|a|We examined the effects of anthocyanidins (cyanidin, delphinidin, malvidin, peonidin, petunidin, pelargonidin) on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-CYP1A1 signaling pathway in human hepatocytes, hepatic HepG2 and intestinal LS174T cancer cells. AhR-dependent reporter gene expression in transfected HepG2 cells was increased by pelargonidin in a concentration-dependent manner at 24h. Similarly, pelargonidin induced the expression of CYP1A1 mRNA up to 5-fold in HepG2 and LS174T cells relative to the induction by 5 nM 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD), the most potent activator of AhR. CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNAs were also increased by pelargonidin in three primary human hepatocytes cultures (approximately 5% of TCDD potency) and the increase in CYP1A1 protein in HepG2 and LS174T cells was comparable to the increase in catalytic activity of CYP1A1 enzyme. Ligand binding analysis demonstrated that pelargonidin was a weak ligand of AhR. Enzyme kinetic analyses using human liver microsomes revealed inhibition of CYP1A1 activity by delphinidin (IC50 78 muM) and pelargonidin (IC50 33 muM). Overall, although most anthocyanidins had no effects on AhR-CYP1A1 signaling, pelargonidin can bind to and activate the AhR and AhR-dependent gene expression, and pelargonidin and delphinidin inhibit the CYP1A1 catalytic activity.

23439660|t|Induction of xenobiotic receptors, transporters, and drug metabolizing enzymes by oxycodone.
23439660|a|Perturbations of the expression of transporters and drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) by opioids can be the locus of deleterious drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Many transporters and DMEs are regulated by xenobiotic receptors [XRs; e.g., pregnane X receptor (PXR), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), and Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)]; however, there is a paucity of information regarding the influence of opioids on XRs. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of oxycodone administration (15 mg/kg intraperitoneally twice daily for 8 days) on liver expression of XRs, transporters, and DMEs in rats. Microarray, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting analyses were used to identify significantly regulated genes. Three XRs (e.g., PXR, CAR, and AhR), 27 transporters (e.g., ABCB1 and SLC22A8), and 19 DMEs (e.g., CYP2B2 and CYP3A1) were regulated (P &lt; 0.05) with fold changes ranging from -46.3 to 17.1. Using MetaCore (computational platform), we identified a unique gene-network of transporters and DMEs assembled around PXR, CAR, and AhR. Therefore, a series of transactivation/translocation assays were conducted to determine whether the observed changes of transporters/DMEs are mediated by direct activation of PXR, CAR, or AhR by oxycodone or its major metabolites (noroxycodone and oxymorphone). Neither oxycodone nor its metabolites activated PXR, CAR, or AhR. Taken together, these findings identify a signature hepatic gene-network associated with repeated oxycodone administration in rats and demonstrate that oxycodone alters the expression of many transporters and DMEs (without direct activation of PXR, CAR, and AhR), which could lead to undesirable DDIs after coadministration of substrates of these transporters/DMEs with oxycodone.

23454145|t|Relative expression of cholesterol transport-related proteins and inflammation markers through the induction of 7-ketosterol-mediated stress in Caco-2 cells.
23454145|a|Human diets contain sterol oxidation products that can induce cytotoxic effects, mainly caused by cholesterol oxides. However, phytosterol oxides effects have been less extensively investigated. This study evaluates the production of inflammatory biomarkers (IL-1beta, IL-8, IL-10, TNFalpha) and the influence of gene expression transporters and enzymes related to cholesterol absorption and metabolism (NPC1L1, ABCG5/8, HMGCoA, ACAT) produced by 7-ketosterols (stigmasterol/cholesterol) in Caco-2 cells. These effects were linked to intracellular signaling pathways by using several inhibitors. Results showed 7-ketostigmasterol to have a greater proinflammatory potential than 7-ketocholesterol. In non-pre-treated cells, only efflux transporters were down-regulated by 7-ketosterols, showing a greater influence upon ABCG5 expression. Cell-pre-incubation with bradykinin induced changes in ABCG expression levels after 7-ketostigmasterol-incubation; however, the energetic metabolism inhibition reduced NPC1L1 expression only in 7-ketocholesterol-incubated cells. In non-pre-treated cells, HMG-CoA was up-regulated by both 7-ketosterols. However, exposure to inhibitors down-regulated the expression levels, mainly in 7-ketocholesterol-incubated cells. While ACAT expression values in non-pre-treated cells were unchanged, exposure to inhibitors caused down-regulation of mRNA levels. These results suggest that internalization and excretion of 7-ketostigmasterol is probably influenced by [Ca]i, which also could mediate HMGCoA activity in POPs metabolism. However, energetic metabolism and reducing equivalents exert different influences upon the 7-ketosterol internalization.

23459167|t|Differential phosphoproteome of the striatum from pleiotrophin knockout and midkine knockout mice treated with amphetamine: correlations with amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity.
23459167|a|The neurotrophic factors pleiotrophin (PTN) and midkine (MK) have been shown to modulate amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity. Accordingly, PTN-/- and MK-/- mice show an increased vulnerability to amphetamine-induced neurotoxic effects. In an effort to uncover new pharmacological targets to prevent amphetamine neurotoxic effects, we have now used a proteomic approach to study protein phosphorylation, in which we combined phosphoprotein enrichment, by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, in order to identify the phosphoproteins regulated in the striatum of PTN-/-, MK-/- and wild type (WT) mice treated with amphetamine. We identified 13 differentially expressed phosphoproteins that are judged to be relevant in the neuroprotective roles of PTN and MK against amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity. It is very interesting to note that 4 of these phosphoproteins, annexin A7 (ANXA7), COP9 signalosome subunit 5 (COPS5), aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1 member A1 (ALDH1A1) and creatine kinase U-type (CKMT1), are known to be involved in Parkinson's disease, a result of significant importance since PTN and MK have been also demonstrated to limit Parkinson's disease (PD) progress and have been suggested to be among the important genetic factors possibly preventing the development of PD in methamphetamine abusers. The data identify phosphoproteins differentially regulated by amphetamine treatment and/or the presence of endogenous PTN/MK which may be relevant mediators of PTN/MK neuroprotective effects against amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity. The data support further studies to validate the phosphoproteins here identified as possible new pharmacological targets to prevent amphetamine neurotoxic effects.

23462526|t|Cell cycle arrest, extracellular matrix changes and intrinsic apoptosis in human melanoma cells are induced by Boron Neutron Capture Therapy.
23462526|a|Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) involves the selective accumulation of boron carriers in tumor tissue followed by irradiation with a thermal or epithermal neutron beam. This therapy is therefore a cellular irradiation suited to treat tumors that have infiltrated into healthy tissues. BNCT has been used clinically to treat patients with cutaneous melanomas which have a high mortality. Human normal melanocytes and melanoma cells were treated with BNCT at different boronophenylalanine concentrations for signaling pathways analysis. BNCT induced few morphological alterations in normal melanocytes, with a negligible increase in free radical production. Melanoma cells treated with BNCT showed significant extracellular matrix (ECM) changes and a significant cyclin D1 decrease, suggesting cell death by necrosis and apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, respectively. BNCT also induced a significant increase in cleaved caspase-3 and a decrease in the mitochondrial electrical potential with selectivity for melanoma cells. Normal melanocytes had no significant differences due to BNCT treatment, confirming the data from the literature regarding the selectivity of BNCT. The results from this study suggest that some signaling pathways are involved in human melanoma treatment by BNCT, such as cell cycle arrest, ECM changes and intrinsic apoptosis.

23466342|t|Reversal of P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance is induced by mollugin in MCF-7/adriamycin cells.
23466342|a|P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an important efflux transporter, is encoded by the MDR1 class of genes and is a central element of the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenomenon in cancer cells. In the present study, we investigated whether mollugin, purified from roots of Rubica cordifolia L., down-regulated MDR1 expression in MCF-7/adriamycin (MCF-7/adr) cells, a human breast multidrug-resistant cancer cell line. Mollugin treatment significantly inhibited MDR1 expression by blocking MDR1 transcription. Mollugin treatment also significantly increased intracellular accumulation of the fluorescently-tagged P-gp substrate, rhodamine-123. The suppression of MDR1 promoter activity and protein expression was mediated through mollugin-induced activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Furthermore, mollugin inhibited MDR1 expression through the suppression of NF-kappaB and CREB activation. Interestingly, mollugin also inhibited COX-2 expression. These results suggest that mollugin treatment enhanced suppression of P-gp expression by inhibiting the NF-kappaB signaling pathway and COX-2 expression, as well as attenuating CRE transcriptional activity through AMPK activation.

23479079|t|Sulfide induces apoptosis and Rho kinase-dependent cell blebbing in Jurkat cells.
23479079|a|Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a toxic gaseous substance, and accidental exposure to high concentrations of H2S has been reported to be lethal to humans. Inhaled and absorbed H2S is partially dissolved within the circulation and causes toxic effects on lymphocytes. However, the mechanisms involved in H2S toxicity have not been well documented. In this study, we examined the cellular uptake and injury of sulfide-exposed human T lymphocytes (Jurkat). Cells were exposed to a H2S donor, sodium hydroxysulfide (NaHS), at pH 6.0, 7.0, or 8.0 for 1 h at 37  C in a sealed conical tube to avoid the loss of dissolved H2S gas. Cytotoxicity and cellular sulfide concentrations increased dramatically as the pH of the NaHS solution decreased. Sulfide enhanced the cleavage of caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and induced early cellular apoptosis. A pan-caspase inhibitor reduced sulfide-induced apoptosis. These results indicate that sulfide induces pH-dependent and caspase-dependent apoptosis. We also found that blebbing of the plasma membrane occurred in sulfide-exposed cells. Both ROCK-1 and ROCK-2 (Rho kinases) were activated by sulfide, and sulfide-induced cell blebbing was suppressed by a ROCK inhibitor, suggesting that a Rho pathway is involved in sulfide-induced blebbing in lymphocytes.

23479318|t|Association of cadmium and lead with antioxidant status and incidence of benign prostatic hyperplasia in patients of Western India.
23479318|a|The association of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) in the pathophysiology and progression of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) has been evaluated in an epidemiological study with 116 BPH patients of the western part of India. The prostatic acid phosphatase activity, prostate-specific antigen, maximum urinary flow rate (Q max), and redox status of BPH patients were correlated with Cd and Pb contents. Additionally, patients were also separated on the basis of their age, genetic lineage, and additive habits and correlated with the Cd, Pb, and Q max levels. Our results suggest that the accumulation of toxic metals in prostate tissue has a significant positive correlation with the pathogenesis of BPH. Cd and Pb exert their effects through altered antioxidant defense mechanisms, ultimately leading to increased BPH severity. Progression of the pathogenesis also depends on other factors such as additive habits, genetic lineage, and age of the patients.

23485615|t|Platycodi Radix attenuates dimethylnitrosamine-induced liver fibrosis in rats by inducing Nrf2-mediated antioxidant enzymes.
23485615|a|The purpose of this study was to investigate the anti-fibrotic effects of the aqueous extract of the Platycodi Radix root (Changkil: CK) on dimethylnitrosamine (DMN)-induced liver fibrosis in rats. DMN treatment for 4 weeks led to marked liver fibrosis as assessed by serum biochemistry, histopathological examination, and hepatic lipid peroxidation and collagen content. CK significantly inhibited DMN-induced increases in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities, fibrosis score, and hepatic malondialdehyde and collagen content. CK also inhibited DMN-induced reductions in rat body and liver weights. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot analyses revealed that CK inhibited DMN-induced increases in matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) mRNA, and collagen type I and alpha-smooth muscle actin protein. DMN-induced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation was reduced by CK treatment. Furthermore, CK induced activation of nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-mediated antioxidant enzymes such as gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in HepG2 cells. These results demonstrated that CK attenuates DMN-induced liver fibrosis through the activation of Nrf2-mediated antioxidant enzymes.

23485651|t|Cadmium telluride quantum dots cause oxidative stress leading to extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells.
23485651|a|The mechanisms of toxicity related to human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cell exposures to cadmium telluride quantum dots (CdTe-QDs) were investigated. CdTe-QDs caused cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Treated cells showed an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS). Altered antioxidant levels were demonstrated by depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH), a decreased ratio of reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) and an increased NF-E2-related Factor 2 (Nrf2) activation. Enzyme assays showed that superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was elevated whereas catalase (CAT) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities were depressed. Further analyses revealed that CdTe-QD exposure resulted in apoptosis, indicated by changes in levels of caspase-3 activity, poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage and phosphatidylserine externalization. Extrinsic apoptotic pathway markers such as Fas levels and caspase-8 activity increased as a result of CdTe-QD exposure. Involvement of the intrinsic/mitochondrial apoptotic pathway was indicated by decreased levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) protein and mitochondrial cytochrome c, and by increased levels of mitochondrial Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and cytosolic cytochrome c. Further, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) such as c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erk1/2), and p38 were all activated. Our findings reveal that CdTe-QDs cause oxidative stress, interfere with antioxidant defenses and activate protein kinases, leading to apoptosis via both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Since the effects of CdTe-QDs on selected biomarkers were similar or greater compared to those of CdCl2 at equivalent concentrations of cadmium, the study suggests that the toxicity of CdTe-QDs arises from a combination of the effects of cadmium and ROS generated from the NPs.

23494106|t|Toxicological profiles of selected synthetic cannabinoids showing high binding affinities to the cannabinoid receptor subtype CB1.
23494106|a|Products containing synthetic cannabinoids are consumed as a surrogate for marihuana due to their non-detectability with commonly used drug tests and their strong cannabimimetic effects. Because data concerning their toxicological properties are scarce, the cytotoxic, genotoxic, immunomodulatory, and hormonal activities of four naphthoylindole compounds (JWH-018, JWH-073, JWH-122 and JWH-210) and of one benzoylindole (AM-694) were studied in human cell lines and primary cells; tetrahydrocannabinol was included as the classical non-endogenous cannabinoid receptor ligand. All compounds induced damage to the cell membranes of buccal (TR146) and breast (MCF-7) derived cells at concentrations of &gt;=75-100 muM. No cytotoxic responses were seen in other assays which reflect mitochondrial damage, protein synthesis, and lysosomal activities. JWH-073 and JWH-122 induced DNA migration in buccal and liver cells (HepG2) in single cell gel electrophoresis assays, while JWH-210 was only in the latter cell line active. No estrogenic activities were detected in bone marrow cells (U2-OS), but all compounds caused anti-estrogenic effects at levels between 2.1 and 23.0 muM. Furthermore, no impact on cytokine release (i.e., on IL-10, IL-6, IL-12/23p40 and TNFalpha levels) was seen in LPS-stimulated human PBMCs, except with JWH-210 and JWH-122 which caused a decrease of TNFalpha and IL-12/23p40. All toxic effects were observed with concentrations higher than those expected in body fluids of users. Since genotoxic effects are in general linear over a wide concentration range and the exposure levels may be higher in epithelial cells than [corrected] in serum, further experimental work is required to find out if DNA damage takes place in drug users.

23500659|t|Role of the phytoestrogenic, pro-apoptotic and anti-oxidative properties of silymarin in inhibiting experimental benign prostatic hyperplasia in rats.
23500659|a|Androgen and estrogen play an important role in the pathogenesis of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Estrogen exerts its action through two distinct estrogen receptors (ERs) either ER-alpha or ER-beta. The phytoestrogenic property of silymarin (SIL) has been previously characterized. Thus, this study examined the protective effect of SIL against testosterone-induced BPH in rats. In an initial dose-response study, SIL in a dose of 50mg/kg was the most effective in preventing the rise in prostate weight, prostate weight/body weight ratio and histopathologic changes induced by testosterone. Testosterone significantly decreased ER-beta and increased ER-alpha and AR expressions as compared to the control group and these effects were significantly ameliorated by SIL. Furthermore, SIL significantly protected against testosterone-provoked decline in mRNA expression of P21(WAF1/Cip1) and Bax/Bcl-xl ratio as well as caspase-3 activity. SIL minimized the number of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) positive cells as compared to testosterone-treated group. Moreover, SIL significantly blunted the inducible NF-kappaB expression and restored the oxidative status to within normal values in the prostatic tissues. Collectively these findings elucidate the effectiveness of SIL in preventing testosterone-induced BPH in rats. This could be attributed, at least partly, to its phytoestrogenic, pro-apoptotic and anti-oxidative properties.

23512537|t|Metabolism of beclomethasone dipropionate by cytochrome P450 3A enzymes.
23512537|a|Inhaled glucocorticoids, such as beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP), are the mainstay treatment of asthma. However,   30% of patients exhibit little to no benefit from treatment. It has been postulated that glucocorticoid resistance, or insensitivity, is attributable to individual differences in glucocorticoid receptor-mediated processes. It is possible that variations in cytochrome P450 3A enzyme-mediated metabolism of BDP may contribute to this phenomenon. This hypothesis was explored by evaluating the contributions of CYP3A4, 3A5, 3A7, and esterase enzymes in the metabolism of BDP in vitro and relating metabolism to changes in CYP3A enzyme mRNA expression via the glucocorticoid receptor in lung and liver cells. CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 metabolized BDP via hydroxylation ([M4] and [M6]) and dehydrogenation ([M5]) at similar rates; CYP3A7 did not metabolize BDP. A new metabolite [M6], formed by the combined action of esterases and CYP3A4 hydroxylation, was also characterized. To validate the results observed using microsomes and recombinant enzymes, studies were also conducted using A549 lung and DPX2 liver cells. Both liver and lung cells produced esterase-dependent metabolites [M1-M3], with [M1] correlating with CYP3A5 mRNA induction in A549 cells. Liver cells produced both hydroxylated and dehydrogenated metabolites [M4, M5, and M6], but lung cells produced only the dehydrogenated metabolite [M5]. These studies show that CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 metabolize BDP to inactive metabolites and suggest that differences in the expression or function of these enzymes in the lung and/or liver could influence BDP disposition in humans.

23523557|t|Antagonism of the transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) attenuates hyperalgesia and urinary bladder overactivity in cyclophosphamide-induced haemorrhagic cystitis.
23523557|a|The aim of this study was to investigate the involvement of the transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) in haemorrhagic cystitis, the main side effect of cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy. Hannover female rats received intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of cyclophosphamide (three doses of 100 mg/kg, every other day, in a total of five days). This treatment was followed by the treatment with TRPA1 antagonist HC 030031 (50 mg/kg, p.o.). The threshold for hindpaw withdrawal or abdominal retraction to von Frey Hair and the locomotor activity were measured. The treatment with the TRPA1 antagonist HC 030031 significantly decreased mechanical hyperalgesia induced by cyclophosphamide without interfere with locomotor activity. Urodynamic parameters were performed by cystometry 24 h after a single treatment with cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg, i.p.) in control and HC 030031 treated rats. Analyses of the urodynamic parameters showed that a single dose of cyclophosphamide was enough to significantly increase the number and amplitude of non-voiding contractions and to decrease the voided volume and voiding efficiency, without significantly altering basal, threshold or maximum pressure. The treatment with HC 030031 either before (100 mg/kg, p.o.) or after (30 mg/kg, i.v.) cyclophosphamide inhibited the non-voiding contractions but failed to counteract the loss in voiding efficiency. Our data demonstrates that nociceptive symptoms and urinary bladder overactivity caused by cyclophosphamide, in part, are dependent upon the activation of TRPA1. In this context, the antagonism of the receptor may be an alternative to minimise the urotoxic symptoms caused by this chemotherapeutic agent.

23524313|t|Hypocholesterolemic effect of daily fisetin supplementation in high fat fed Sprague-Dawley rats.
23524313|a|We aimed to test whether fisetin could modulate cholesterol homeostasis in rats with diet-induced hypercholesterolemia, and further investigated the underlying mechanisms by which fisetin exerts its cholesterol lowering effect. Blood lipid profile, hepatic cholesterol content, as well as gene expressions in cholesterol metabolism were examined. Elevated levels of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, along with hepatic cholesterol content in a high fat group were found to be significantly reduced by fisetin. The high fat diet significantly decreased hepatic mRNA levels of LDLR, SREBP2, HMGCR and PCSK9 in comparison to the control diet, however, fisetin did not further elicit any changes in mRNA levels of the same genes. The high fat diet dramatically increased the transcript levels of CYP7A1, which was subsequently reversed by the fisetin. In HepG2 cells, fisetin was found to increase the levels of a nuclear form of SREBP2 and LDLR. In conclusion, fisetin supplementation displayed hypocholesterolemic effects by modulating the expression of genes associated with cholesterol and bile acid metabolism.

23528251|t|Cross-talk between constitutive androstane receptor and hypoxia-inducible factor in the regulation of gene expression.
23528251|a|Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) and 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase are often activated under similar physiological conditions. Constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) translocates into the nucleus in accordance with 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase and thus confers transactivation. The aim of the present study was to investigate a possible link between CAR and HIFalpha. Phenobarbital (PB), a typical CAR activator, increased the gene expression of HIF-target genes in the livers of mice, including erythropoietin, heme oxygenase-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor-a. PB induced an accumulation of nuclear HIF-1alpha and an increase in the HIF-responsive element-mediated transactivation in HepG2 cells. Cobalt chloride, a typical HIF activator, induced the gene expression of CAR-target genes, including cyp2b9 and cyp2b10, an accumulation of nuclear CAR and an increase in the PB-responsive enhancer module-mediated transactivation in the mouse liver. Immunoprecipitation-immunoblot and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses suggest that CAR binds to the PB-responsive enhancer module with HIF-1alpha in the liver of untreated mice and that the complex dissociates upon PB treatment. Taken together these results suggest that CAR and HIF-alpha interact and reciprocally modulate the functions of each other.

23535185|t|Galangin attenuates mast cell-mediated allergic inflammation.
23535185|a|A great number of people are suffering from allergic inflammatory disease such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, and sinusitis. Therefore discovery of drugs for the treatment of these diseases is an important subject in human health. In this study, we investigated anti-allergic inflammatory effect of galangin and underlying mechanisms of action using in vitro and in vivo models. Galangin inhibited histamine release by the reduction of intracellular calcium in phorbol 12-mystate 13-acetate plus calcium ionophore A23187-stimulated human mast cells (HMC-1). Galangin decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta, and IL-8. The inhibitory effect of galangin on theses pro-inflammatory cytokines was related with c-Jun N-terminal kinases, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, nuclear factor-kappaB, and caspase-1. Furthermore, galangin attenuated IgE-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis and the expression of histamine receptor 1 at the inflamed tissue. The inhibitory effects of galangin were more potent than cromolyn, a known anti-allergic drug. Our results showed that galangin down-regulates mast cell-derived allergic inflammatory reactions by blocking histamine release and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In light of in vitro and in vivo anti-allergic inflammatory effects, galangin could be a beneficial anti-allergic inflammatory agent.

23535287|t|Cajaninstilbene acid (CSA) exerts cytoprotective effects against oxidative stress through the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant pathway.
23535287|a|Cajaninstilbene acid (CSA), an active compound separated from pigeon pea leaves, possesses the highly efficient antioxidant activities. Transcription factor nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is an important regulator of cellular oxidative stress. This study examined the role of Nrf2 in CSA-mediated antioxidant effects on human hepatocarcinoma (HepG2) cell line. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon H2O2 and CSA treatment was lower than that of H2O2 alone. CSA activated Nrf2 as evaluated by Western blotting. A luciferase reporter assay also demonstrated that CSA-activated signaling resulted in the increased transcriptional activity of Nrf2 through binding to the antioxidant response element (ARE) enhancer sequence. Our study indicated that treatment of HepG2 cells with CSA induces Nrf2-dependent ARE activity and gene expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunits by activation of PI3K/AKT, ERK and JNK signaling pathways. Inhibition of Nrf2 by siRNA reduced CSA-induced upregulation of these Nrf2-related enzymes. These results suggest that the Nrf2/ARE pathway plays an important role in the regulation of CSA-mediated antioxidant effects in HepG2 cells.

23536519|t|Resveratrol inhibits proliferation, angiogenesis and induces apoptosis in colon cancer cells: calorie restriction is the force to the cytotoxicity.
23536519|a|The aim of this study was to examine the antitumour activity of resveratrol in human colorectal cancer cell lines (HCT116 and Caco2) and to explore its mechanism of action assuming that it is by calorie-restriction effect. Resveratrol inhibited the proliferation of colon cancer cells with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) equal to 50 and 130 muM for HCT116 and Caco2, respectively. Caco2 cells appeared with significant time-dependent increase in the glycolytic pathway, a behaviour that was absent in HCT116 cells. Resveratrol (100 muM) significantly decreased the glycolytic enzymes (pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase) in Caco2 cells, while an increase in citrate synthase activity and a decrease in glucose consumption were observed in both cell lines. Moreover, resveratrol downregulated the expressions of leptin and c-Myc, and decreased the content of vascular endothelial growth factor. The apoptotic markers, caspases 3 and 8, were activated and the Bax/BCl2 ratio was increased. The study suggested a promising anticancer activity of resveratrol, calorie-restriction pathway may be one of the driving forces for this activity.

23539296|t|p38 Mitogen-activated protein kinase regulates nuclear receptor CAR that activates the CYP2B6 gene.
23539296|a|The constitutive active/androstane receptor (CAR) regulates hepatic drug metabolism by activating genes, such as cytochrome P450, and certain transferases. p38 Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is highly activated in human primary hepatocytes but barely in human hepatoma cell lines including HepG2 cells. Liganded-CAR induced CYP2B6 mRNA in human primary hepatocytes far more effectively than in HepG2 cells ectopically expressing CAR. In the present study, we found that activation of p38 MAPK by anisomycin potentiated induction of CYP2B6 mRNA by CAR ligand in HepG2 cells to levels observed in ligand-treated human primary hepatocytes. siRNA knockdown of p38 MAPK abrogated the ability of anisomycin to synergistically induce CYP2B6 mRNA. In addition to CYP2B6, anisomycin cotreatment potentiated an increase in CYP2A7 and CYP2C9 mRNAs but not CYP3A4 or UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 mRNAs. Thus, activated p38 MAPK is required for liganded-CAR to selectively activate a set of genes that encode drug-metabolizing enzymes. Our present results suggest that CAR-mediated induction of these enzymes cannot be understood by ligand binding alone because the specificity and magnitude of induction are codetermined by a given cell signaling, such as p38 MAPK; both physiologic and pathophysiological states of cell signaling may have a strong impact in hepatic drug-metabolizing capability during treatments.

23541125|t|Activation of transient receptor potential ankyrin-1 (TRPA1) in lung cells by wood smoke particulate material.
23541125|a|Cigarette smoke, diesel exhaust, and other combustion-derived particles activate the calcium channel transient receptor potential ankyrin-1 (TRPA1), causing irritation and inflammation in the respiratory tract. It was hypothesized that wood smoke particulate and select chemical constituents thereof would also activate TRPA1 in lung cells, potentially explaining the adverse effects of wood and other forms of biomass smoke on the respiratory system. TRPA1 activation was assessed using calcium imaging assays in TRPA1-overexpressing HEK-293 cells, mouse primary trigeminal neurons, and human adenocarcinoma (A549) lung cells. Particles from pine and mesquite smoke were less potent agonists of TRPA1 than an equivalent mass concentration of an ethanol extract of diesel exhaust particles; pine particles were comparable in potency to cigarette smoke condensate, and mesquite particles were the least potent. The fine particulate (PM &lt; 2.5 mum) of wood smoke were the most potent TRPA1 agonists and several chemical constituents of wood smoke particulate, 3,5-ditert-butylphenol, coniferaldehyde, formaldehyde, perinaphthenone, agathic acid, and isocupressic acid, were TRPA1 agonists. Pine particulate activated TRPA1 in mouse trigeminal neurons and A549 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, which was inhibited by the TRPA1 antagonist HC-030031. TRPA1 activation by wood smoke particles occurred through the electrophile/oxidant-sensing domain (i.e., C621/C641/C665/K710), based on the inhibition of cellular responses when the particles were pretreated with glutathione; a role for the menthol-binding site of TRPA1 (S873/T874) was demonstrated for 3,5-ditert-butylphenol. This study demonstrated that TRPA1 is a molecular sensor for wood smoke particulate and several chemical constituents thereof, in sensory neurons and A549 cells, suggesting that TRPA1 may mediate some of the adverse effects of wood smoke in humans.

23542819|t|The ethylene bis-dithiocarbamate fungicide Mancozeb activates voltage-gated KCNQ2 potassium channel.
23542819|a|Mancozeb (manganese/zinc ethylene bis-dithiocarbamate) is an organometallic fungicide that has been associated with human neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration. In a high-throughput screen for modulators of KCNQ2 channel, a fundamental player modulating neuronal excitability, Mancozeb, was found to significantly potentiate KCNQ2 activity. Mancozeb was validated electrophysiologically as a KCNQ2 activator with an EC50 value of 0.92+-0.23muM. Further examination showed that manganese but not zinc ethylene bis-dithiocarbamate is the active component for the positive modulation effects. In addition, the compounds are effective when the metal ions are substituted by iron but lack potentiation activity when the metal ions are substituted by sodium, signifying the importance of the metal ion. However, the iron (Fe(3+)) alone, organic ligands alone or the mixture of iron with the organic ligand did not show any potentiation effect, suggesting as the active ingredient is a specific complex rather than two separate additive or synergistic components. Our study suggests that potentiation on KCNQ2 potassium channels might be the possible mechanism of Mancozeb toxicity in the nervous system.

23543413|t|A re-evaluation of the role of hCTR1, the human high-affinity copper transporter, in platinum-drug entry into human cells.
23543413|a|Cisplatin (cDDP) is an anticancer drug used in a number of malignancies, including testicular, ovarian, cervical, bladder, lung, head, and neck cancers. Its use is limited by the development of resistance, often rationalized via effects on cellular uptake. It has been claimed that human copper transporter 1 (hCTR1), the human high-affinity copper transporter, is the major entry pathway for cDDP and related drugs via a mechanism that mimics copper. This is an unexpected property of hCTR1, a highly selective copper (I) transporter. We compared the uptake rates of copper with cDDP (and several analogs) into human embryonic kidney 293 cells overexpressing wild-type or mutant hCTR1, mouse embryonic fibroblasts that do or do not express CTR1, and human ovarian tumor cells that are sensitive or resistant to cDDP. We have also compared the effects of extracellular copper, which causes regulatory endocytosis of hCTR1, to those of cDDP. We confirm the correlation between higher hCTR1 levels and higher platinum drug uptake in tumor cells sensitive to the drug. However, we show that hCTR1 is not the major entry route of platinum drugs, and that the copper transporter is not internalized in response to extracellular drug. Our data suggest the major entry pathway for platinum drugs is not saturable at relevant concentrations and not protein-mediated. Clinical trials have been initiated that depend upon regulating membrane levels of hCTR1. If reduced drug uptake is a major factor in resistance, hCTR1 is unlikely to be a productive target in attempts to enhance efficacy, although the proteins involved in copper homeostasis may play a role.

23545134|t|Chronic dietary exposure to chlorpyrifos causes behavioral impairments, low activity of brain membrane-bound acetylcholinesterase, and increased brain acetylcholinesterase-R mRNA.
23545134|a|Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is an organophosphate (OP) insecticide that is metabolically activated to the highly toxic chlorpyrifos oxon. Dietary exposure is the main route of intoxication for non-occupational exposures. However, only limited behavioral effects of chronic dietary exposure have been investigated. Therefore, male Wistar rats were fed a dose of 5mg/kg/day of CPF for thirty-one weeks. Animals were evaluated in spatial learning and impulsivity tasks after 21 weeks of CPF dietary exposure and one week after exposure ended, respectively. In addition, the degree of inhibition of brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was evaluated for both the soluble and particulate forms of the enzyme, as well as AChE gene expression. Also, brain acylpeptide hydrolase (APH) was investigated as an alternative target for OP-mediated effects. All variables were evaluated at various time points in response to CPF diet and after exposure ended. Results from behavioral procedures suggest cognitive and emotional disorders. Moreover, low levels of activity representing membrane-bound oligomeric forms (tetramers) were also observed. In addition, increased brain AChE-R mRNA levels were detected after four weeks of CPF dietary exposure. However, no changes in levels of brain APH were observed among groups. In conclusion, our data point to a relationship between cognitive impairments and changes in AChE forms, specifically to a high inhibition of the particulate form and a modification of alternative splicing of mRNA during CPF dietary exposure.

23558297|t|Vinclozolin: a case study on the identification of endocrine active substances in the past and a future perspective.
23558297|a|In the late 1980s vinclozolin was tested for prenatal developmental toxicity in rats for registration purposes in USA. At 1000mg/kgbw, 95% of all fetuses were female upon visual inspection (ano-genital distance determination). Anti-androgenic effects (AA) were also noted in a subsequent 2-generation study. These findings triggered mechanistic investigations at BASF and at US-EPA. Results published by the latter were the starting point of the endocrine disruption (ED) discussion in the 1990s. AA effects of vinclozolin are mediated by two metabolites, which have an antagonistic effect on the androgen receptor. Currently, determination of ED has become a major end-point in toxicology testing and the US-EPA has set up an elaborated testing paradigm to fulfill this requirement. Future screening for ED can be improved making use of new technologies. ED modes of action can be determined by three alternative (3R) methods. Steroid synthesis in H295R cells (1), androgen-receptor binding in modified yeast (2) and metabolomics (3). Using vinclozolin as a case study, results indicate: (1) an effect on steroid synthesis in vitro, (2) an antagonistic effect on the androgen receptor and (3) that the metabolome profile of vinclozolin is similar to that of other receptor mediated anti-androgens (e.g. flutamide).

23562495|t|TRP and ASIC channels mediate the antinociceptive effect of citronellyl acetate.
23562495|a|BACKGROUND: Citronellyl acetate (CAT), a monoterpene product of the secondary metabolism of plants, has been shown in the literature to possess several different biological activities. However, no antinociceptive abilities have yet been discussed. Here, we used acute pain animal models to describe the antinociceptive action of CAT. METHODS: The acetic acid-induced writhing test and the paw-licking test, in which paw licking was induced by glutamate and formalin, were performed to evaluate the antinociceptive action of CAT and to determine the involvement of PKC, PKA, TRPV1, TRPA1, TRPM8 and ASIC in its antinociceptive mechanism. To do so, we induced paw-linking using agonists. RESULTS: CAT was administered intragastrically (25, 50, 75, 100 and 200 mg/kg), and the two higher doses caused antinociceptive effects in the acetic acid model; the highest dose reduced pain for 4h after it was administered (200 mg/kg). In the formalin test, two doses of CAT promoted antinociception in both the early and later phases of the test. The glutamate test showed that its receptors are involved in the antinociceptive mechanism of CAT. Pretreatment with CAT did not alter locomotor activity or motor coordination. In an investigation into the participation of TRP channels and ASICs in CAT's antinociceptive mechanism, we used capsaicin (2.2 mug/paw), cinnamaldehyde (10 mmol/paw), menthol (1.2 mmol/paw) and acidified saline (2% acetic acid, pH 1.98). The results showed that TRPV1, TRPM8 and ASIC, but not TRPA1, are involved in the antinociceptive mechanism. Finally, the involvement of PKC and PKA was also studied, and we showed that both play a role in the antinociceptive mechanism of CAT. CONCLUSION: The results of this work contribute information regarding the antinociceptive properties of CAT on acute pain and show that, at least in part, TRPV1, TRPM8, ASIC, glutamate receptors, PKC and PKA participate in CAT's antinociceptive mechanism.

23562496|t|2-Hydroxychalcone and xanthohumol inhibit invasion of triple negative breast cancer cells.
23562496|a|Breast cancer is estimated as one of the most common causes of cancer death among women. In particular, triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs), which do not express the genes for estrogen/progesterone receptors (ER/PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), have been associated with poor prognosis and metastasis. Chalcones, the biosynthetic precursors of flavonoids present in edible plants, exert cytotoxic and chemopreventive activities. Although mounting evidence suggests the anticancer properties of chalcones, limited information is available regarding the inhibitory effects of chalcones on the aggressiveness of breast cancer cells. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of chalcone and its derivatives on the growth and the invasiveness of TNBC cells. Here, we showed that treatment with chalcone, 2-hydroxychalcone, and xanthohumol for 24h inhibited the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells with IC50 values of 18.1, 4.6, and 6.7 muM, respectively. Similarly, Chalcone, 2-hydroxychalcone, and xanthohumol also exerted cytotoxicity in another TNBC cell line, Hs578T. Neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, 4-methoxychalcone, and hesperidin methylchalcone did not show the cytotoxicity on the MDA-MB-231 cells. Xanthohumol and 2-hydroxychalcone induced apoptosis by Bcl-2 downregulation. Importantly, 2-hydroxychalcone and xanthohumol exerted more potent inhibitory effects on the proliferation, MMP-9 expression and invasive phenotype of MDA-MB-231 than chalcone. These results suggest a potential application of these chalcones as anticancer agents that can alleviate malignant progression of TNBC.

23564645|t|Detection of statin cytotoxicity is increased in cells expressing the OATP1B1 transporter.
23564645|a|Cytotoxicity of a compound is determined by the intracellular concentration mediated both by passive permeability and active uptake through drug transporters. However, the major liver uptake transporters were either absent or expressed at significantly lower levels in human liver cell lines than in human liver. When comparing cytotoxicity of five statins, the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 expressing HEK cells showed a significantly higher sensitivity than the wild-type HEK cells. The IC50 shifts ranged from 9- to &gt;100-fold, and the potency shifts collapsed in the presence of rifampicin, the inhibitor for OATPs. The extent of the IC50 shift correlated with the permeability of the statins with high permeable compounds having smaller shifts and low permeable compounds having larger shifts. The changes in statin potency in transporter-transfected cells reflect the active uptake of statins into the cells, and the increased intracellular drug concentration lead to increased toxicity. The data suggested that uptake transporters have a significant impact on the outcomes of a cell-based assay and should be considered during the early stages of compound toxicity screening in drug discovery. For compounds with low permeability that are likely to undergo transporter-mediated uptake, it is important to test them in transporter-competent cell models.

23566884|t|Tomatidine inhibits invasion of human lung adenocarcinoma cell A549 by reducing matrix metalloproteinases expression.
23566884|a|Tomatidine is an aglycone of glycoalkaloid tomatine in tomato. Tomatidine is found to possess anti-inflammatory properties and may serve as a chemosensitizer in multidrug-resistant tumor cells. However, the effect of tomatidine on cancer cell metastasis remains unclear. This study examines the effect of tomatidine on the migration and invasion of human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cell in vitro. The data demonstrates that tomatidine does not effectively inhibit the viability of A549 cells. When treated with non-toxic doses of tomatidine, cell invasion is markedly suppressed by Boyden chamber invasion assay, while cell migration is not affected. Tomatidine reduces the mRNA level of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9 and increases the expression of reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifs (RECK), as well as tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1). The immunoblotting assays indicate that tomatidine is very effective in suppressing the phosphorylation of Akt and extracellular signal regulating kinase (ERK). In addition, tomatidine significantly decreases the nuclear level of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), which suggests that tomatidine inhibits NF-kappaB activity. Furthermore, the treatment of inhibitors specific for PI3K/Akt (LY294002), ERK (U0126), or NF-kappaB (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate) to A549 cells reduced cell invasion and MMP-2/9 expression. The results suggest that tomatidine inhibits the invasion of A549 cells by reducing the expression of MMPs. It also inhibits ERK and Akt signaling pathways and NF-kappaB activity. These findings demonstrate a new therapeutic potential for tomatidine in anti-metastatic therapy.

23567241|t|Comparative study on transcriptional activity of 17 parabens mediated by estrogen receptor alpha and beta and androgen receptor.
23567241|a|The structure-activity relationships of parabens which are widely used as preservatives for transcriptional activities mediated by human estrogen receptor alpha (hERalpha), hERbeta and androgen receptor (hAR) were investigated. Fourteen of 17 parabens exhibited hERalpha and/or hERbeta agonistic activity at concentrations of &lt;= 1 x 10(-5)M, whereas none of the 17 parabens showed AR agonistic or antagonistic activity. Among 12 parabens with linear alkyl chains ranging in length from C1 to C12, heptylparaben (C7) and pentylparaben (C5) showed the most potent ERalpha and ERbeta agonistic activity in the order of 10(-7)M and 10(-8)M, respectively, and the activities decreased in a stepwise manner as the alkyl chain was shortened to C1 or lengthened to C12. Most parabens showing estrogenic activity exhibited ERbeta-agonistic activity at lower concentrations than those inducing ERalpha-agonistic activity. The estrogenic activity of butylparaben was markedly decreased by incubation with rat liver microsomes, and the decrease of activity was blocked by a carboxylesterase inhibitor. These results indicate that parabens are selective agonists for ERbeta over ERalpha; their interactions with ERalpha/beta are dependent on the size and bulkiness of the alkyl groups; and they are metabolized by carboxylesterases, leading to attenuation of their estrogenic activity.

23567314|t|Evaluation of perfluoroalkyl acid activity using primary mouse and human hepatocytes.
23567314|a|While perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) have been studied at length, less is known about the biological activity of other perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) detected in the environment. Using a transient transfection assay developed in COS-1 cells, our group has previously evaluated a variety of PFAAs for activity associated with activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha). Here we use primary heptatocytes to further assess the biological activity of a similar group of PFAAs using custom designed Taqman Low Density Arrays. Primary mouse and human hepatoyctes were cultured for 48h in the presence of varying concentrations of 12 different PFAAs or Wy14,643, a known activator of PPARalpha. Total RNA was collected and the expression of 48 mouse or human genes evaluated. Gene selection was based on either in-house liver microarray data (mouse) or published data using primary hepatocytes (human). Gene expression in primary mouse hepatocytes was more restricted than expected. Genes typically regulated in whole tissue by PPARalpha agonists were not altered in mouse cells including Acox1, Me1, Acaa1a, Hmgcs1, and Slc27a1. Cyp2b10, a gene regulated by the constitutive androstane receptor and a transcript normally up-regulated by in vivo exposure to PFAAs, was also unchanged in cultured mouse hepatocytes. Cyp4a14, Ehhadh, Pdk4, Cpt1b, and Fabp1 were regulated as expected in mouse cells. A larger group of genes were differentially expressed in human primary hepatocytes, however, little consistency was observed across compounds with respect to which genes produced a significant dose response making the determination of relative biological activity difficult. This likely reflects weaker activation of PPARalpha in human versus rodent cells as well as variation among individual cell donors. Unlike mouse cells, CYP2B6 was up-regulated in human hepatocytes by a number of PFAAs as was PPARdelta. Rankings were conducted on the limited dataset. In mouse hepatocytes, the pattern was similar to that previously observed in the COS-1 reporter cell assay. With the exception of PFHxA, longer chain PFAA carboxylates were the most active. The pattern was similar in human hepatocytes, although PFDA and PFOS showed higher activity than previously observed while PFOA showed somewhat less activity. These data reflect inherent challenges in using primary hepatocytes to predict toxicological response.

23570914|t|Suppression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 via extracellular signal-regulated kinase contributes to bleomycin-induced oxidative stress and fibrogenesis.
23570914|a|Pulmonary fibrosis is a serious and irreversible lung injury with obscure etiologic mechanisms and no effective treatment to date. This study explored a crucial link between oxidative stress and pulmonary fibrogenesis, focusing on nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a core transcription factor in antioxidative regulation systems. Treatment of C57 BL/6 mice with bleomycin increased fibroblast viability and collagen production and significantly downregulated Nrf2. In addition, prominent oxidative stress was indicated by changes in superoxide dismutase, catalase activity, and glutathione and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance levels. In a cell-based model, bleomycin suppressed Nrf2 activation via extracellular signal-related kinase phosphorylation, enhancing intracellular reactive oxygen species in lung fibroblasts and stimulating abnormal cell proliferation and collagen secretion. To confirm this novel mechanism of bleomycin-induced fibrogenesis, we attempted to upregulate Nrf2 and related antioxidant proteins in bleomycin-treated fibroblasts using a putative Nrf2 activator, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, and the results showed that bleomycin-induced fibroblast proliferation and collagen content were attenuated through improved redox balance. Collectively, these results disclose a potential regulatory mechanism in pulmonary fibrosis that will aid the development of new therapies.

23578390|t|Sodium fluoride induces apoptosis in odontoblasts via a JNK-dependent mechanism.
23578390|a|Sodium fluoride (NaF) is widely used for the treatment of dental caries and dentin hypersensitivity. However, its pro-apoptotic effect on odontoblasts may lead to harmful side-effects. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pro-apoptotic effects of NaF in odontoblasts and elucidate the possible underlying molecular mechanisms. NaF generated cytotoxic effects in odontoblast-lineage cell (OLC) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Exposure of cells to 4mM NaF for 24h induced caspase-3 activation, ultrastructural alterations, and resulted in the translocation of Bax to the mitochondria and the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial inter-membrane space into the cytosol, indicating that fluoride-mediated apoptosis is mitochondria-dependent. Fluoride treatment also increased phosphorylation of JNK and ERK, but not p38, and apoptosis induced by fluoride was notably or partly suppressed by treatment with JNK or ERK inhibitors, respectively. Taken together, these findings suggest that NaF induces apoptosis in OLC odontoblasts through a JNK-dependent mitochondrial pathway.

23578391|t|Perinatal exposure to BDE-99 causes learning disorders and decreases serum thyroid hormone levels and BDNF gene expression in hippocampus in rat offspring.
23578391|a|Exposure of pregnant women to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) may mean serious health risks. The main goal of the present study was to examine the neurobehavioral changes in rat offspring that were perinatally exposed to one of the most prevalent PBDEs congeners found in humans, 2,2',4,4',5-pentaBDE (BDE-99). Rat dams were exposed to 0, 1 and 2mg/kg/day of BDE-99 from gestation day 6 to post-natal day 21. When pups were weaning, cortex and hippocampal gene expressions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) of the different isoforms of the thyroid hormone (TH) receptors (TRs) were evaluated. Serum TH levels were also determined. The remaining pups were assessed by neurobehavioral testing for learning and memory function. The results showed that maternal transference of BDE-99 produced a delay in the spatial learning task in the water maze test. Moreover, the open-field test revealed a significant dose-response anxiolytic effect. It was also found that the serum levels of triiodothyronine (T3), tetraiiodothyronine (T4) and free-T4 (FT4) decreased. Although no effect on the gene expression of the different isoforms of TRs was observed, the expression of the TH-mediated gene BDNF was down-regulated in the hippocampus. These results indicate a clear signal disruption of TH and reinforce previous studies in which neurotoxic effects of PBDEs in animal research were observed at levels comparable to those found in humans.

23589329|t|Arsenic inhibits autophagic flux, activating the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway in a p62-dependent manner.
23589329|a|The Nrf2-Keap1 signaling pathway is a protective mechanism promoting cell survival. Activation of the Nrf2 pathway by natural compounds has been proven to be an effective strategy for chemoprevention. Interestingly, a cancer-promoting function of Nrf2 has recently been observed in many types of tumors due to deregulation of the Nrf2-Keap1 axis, which leads to constitutive activation of Nrf2. Here, we report a novel mechanism of Nrf2 activation by arsenic that is distinct from that of chemopreventive compounds. Arsenic deregulates the autophagic pathway through blockage of autophagic flux, resulting in accumulation of autophagosomes and sequestration of p62, Keap1, and LC3. Thus, arsenic activates Nrf2 through a noncanonical mechanism (p62 dependent), leading to a chronic, sustained activation of Nrf2. In contrast, activation of Nrf2 by sulforaphane (SF) and tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) depends upon Keap1-C151 and not p62 (the canonical mechanism). More importantly, SF and tBHQ do not have any effect on autophagy. In fact, SF and tBHQ alleviate arsenic-mediated deregulation of autophagy. Collectively, these findings provide evidence that arsenic causes prolonged activation of Nrf2 through autophagy dysfunction, possibly providing a scenario similar to that of constitutive activation of Nrf2 found in certain human cancers. This may represent a previously unrecognized mechanism underlying arsenic toxicity and carcinogenicity in humans.

23603004|t|Protective effects of naringin against paraquat-induced acute lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis in mice.
23603004|a|The present study evaluates protective effects of naringin against paraquat (PQ)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) and pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Survival probability against PQ intoxication was tested by a single intraperitoneal injection of PQ. Results showed that survival rates of mice exposed to PQ only (50 mg/kg within 7 days) were much lower than that in mice daily treatment with NAC or naringin. Moreover, protection against PQ-induced ALI was tested by daily pretreatment mice with saline, NAC or naringin for 3 days before PQ (30 mg/kg, i.p.). Results showed that increase in leukocytes infiltration and overexpressions of TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 caused by 8h of PQ exposure were dose-dependently ameliorated by naringin. Furthermore, protection against PQ-induced pulmonary fibrosis was tested by pretreatment mice with PQ (20 mg/kg, i.p.), and then daily administration with saline, NAC or naringin for prolonged 21 days. Results showed that naringin of 60 and 120 mg/kg significantly reduced PQ-induced upregulations of TNF-alpha, TGF-beta1, MMP-9 and TIMP-1, levels of pulmonary malonaldehyde and hydroxyproline, as well as pulmonary fibrosis deposition, while increased activities of SOD, GSH-Px and HO-1. These results indicated that naringin had effective protection against PQ-induced ALI and pulmonary fibrosis.

23603059|t|Arsenic upregulates the expression of angiotensin II Type I receptor in mouse aortic endothelial cells.
23603059|a|Although chronic arsenic exposure is a well-known risk for cardiovascular disease and has a strong correlation with hypertension, the molecular pathogenesis underlying arsenic exposure-induced hypertension remains poorly understood. To delineate the pathogenesis, we examined changes in the mRNA levels of 2 angiotensin II Type I receptor (AT1R) subtypes, AT1AR and AT1BR, in a mouse aortic endothelial cell line, END-D. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed significant increases in the mRNA levels of 2 AT1R subtypes, AT1AR and AT1BR following sodium arsenite (SA) treatment. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that SA increases the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, western blot analysis revealed that SA enhances the phosphorylations of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and activated protein 1 (AP-1). These phosphorylations were inhibited by N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an anti-oxidant. Finally, SA-induced AT1R expression was found to be prevented both by NAC and specific JNK inhibitor, SP6001325, strongly indicating that AT1R upregulation is a result of the ROS-mediated activation of the JNK signaling pathway. Taken together, our results indicate that arsenic indeed upregulates the AT1R expression, thus highlighting a role of arsenic-induced aberrant AT1R signaling in the pathogenesis of hypertension.

23603339|t|Dehydroepiandrosterone post-transcriptionally modifies CYP1A2 induction involving androgen receptor.
23603339|a|The pharmacological dosage of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) protects against chemically induced carcinogenesis. The chemoprotective activity of DHEA is attributed to its inhibitory potential for the expression of CYP1A enzymes, which are highly responsible for metabolic activation of several mutagenic and carcinogenic chemicals. The present work investigated whether the chemoprevention by DHEA was due to diminished transcriptional activation of CYP1A genes or to the post-transcriptional modulation of CYP1A expression. In primary human hepatocytes, DHEA diminished the increase in CYP1A activities (7-ethoxyresorufin O-dealkylation and phenacetin O-dealkylation) and in CYP1A2 mRNA level induced by 3-methylcholanthrene, but did not alter the amount of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNA. The androgen receptor seemed to be involved in DHEA-mediated diminishment of CYP1A2 induction, which was attenuated in the presence of bicalutamide, the androgen receptor antagonist. The potential role of the glucocorticoid receptor and estrogen receptor in DHEA-mediated decrease in CYP1A2 induction was excluded. The developed computational model of CYP1A2 induction kinetics and CYP1A2 mRNA degradation proposed that a post-transcriptional mechanism was likely to be the primary mechanism of the DHEA-mediated diminishment of CYP1A2 induction. The hypothesis was confirmed by the results of actinomycin D-chase experiments in MCF-7 and LNCaP cells, displaying that the degradation rates of CYP1A2 mRNA were significantly higher in the cells exposed to DHEA. The novel findings on DHEA-mediated modulation of CYP1A2 mRNA stability may account for the beneficial effects of DHEA by decreasing the metabolic activation of pro-carcinogenic compounds.

23603382|t|Protective effects of selenium on oxidative damage and oxidative stress related gene expression in rat liver under chronic poisoning of arsenic.
23603382|a|Arsenic (As) is a toxic metalloid existing widely in the environment, and chronic exposure to it through contaminated drinking water has become a global problem of public health. The present study focused on the protective effects of selenium on oxidative damage of chronic arsenic poisoning in rat liver. Rats were divided into four groups at random and given designed treatments for 20 weeks. The oxidative damage of liver tissue was evaluated by lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzymes. Oxidative stress related genes were detected to reflect the liver stress state at the molecular level. Compared to the control and Na2SeO3 groups, the MDA content in liver tissue was decreased and the activities of antioxidant enzymes were increased in the Na2SeO3 intervention group. The mRNA levels of SOD1, CAT, GPx and Txnrd1 were increased significantly (P&lt;0.05) in the combined Na2SeO3+NaAsO2 treatment group. The expressions of HSP70 and HO-1 were significantly (P&lt;0.05) increased in the NaAsO2 group and reduced in the combined treatment group. The results indicate that long-term intake of NaAsO2 causes oxidative damage in the rat liver, and Na2SeO3 protects liver cells by adjusting the expression of oxidative stress related genes to improve the activities of antioxidant enzymes.

23609606|t|In vitro exploration of potential mechanisms of toxicity of the human hepatotoxic drug fenclozic acid.
23609606|a|The carboxylic acid NSAID fenclozic acid exhibited an excellent preclinical safety profile and promising clinical efficacy, yet was withdrawn from clinical development in 1971 due to hepatotoxicity observed in clinical trials. A variety of modern in vitro approaches have been used to explore potential underlying mechanisms. Covalent binding studies were undertaken with [(14)C]-fenclozic acid to investigate the possible role of reactive metabolites. Time-dependent covalent binding to protein was observed in NADPH-supplemented liver microsomes, although no metabolites were detected in these incubations or in reactive metabolite trapping experiments. In human hepatocytes, covalent binding was observed at lower levels than in microsomes and a minor uncharacterizable metabolite was also observed. In addition, covalent binding was observed in incubations undertaken with dog and rat hepatocytes, where a taurine conjugate of the drug was detected. Although an acyl glucuronide metabolite was detected when liver microsomes from human, rat and dog were supplemented with UDPGA, there was no detectable UDPGA-dependent covalent binding. No effects were observed when fenclozic acid was assessed for P450-dependent and P450-independent cytotoxicity to THLE cell lines, time-dependent inhibition of five major human cytochrome P450 enzymes, inhibition of the biliary efflux transporters BSEP and MRP2 or mitochondrial toxicity to THLE or HepG2 cells. These data suggest that Phase 1 bioactivation plays a role in the hepatotoxicity of fenclozic acid and highlight the unique insight into mechanisms of human drug toxicity that can be provided by investigations of biotransformation and covalent binding to proteins.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the major regulators of endothelial cell survival and is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of COPD. Fibroblasts are a significant source of VEGF in the lungs; however the effect of cigarette smoke exposure on VEGF release by fibroblasts is not fully understood. We hypothesized that cigarette smoke-induced disturbed VEGF release by human lung fibroblasts is a potential pathogenic mechanism that could contribute to COPD. Cigarette smoke extract (CSE) was prepared by modification of the methods of Carp and Janoff (American Review of Respiratory Disease, 1978). Human fetal lung fibroblasts (HFL-1) were exposed to different concentrations of CSE and for different durations. VEGF release into the media was measured using ELISA. TGF-beta1 receptor (TbetaR1)/Smad3 as a potential pathway for CSE modulated VEGF release was also investigated using biochemical analyses and siRNA inhibition of Smad3 and siRNA and pharmacologic inhibition of TbetaR1. CSE induced VEGF release by HFL-1 in concentration and time dependent manner. This was confirmed in two additional types of primary human fetal lung fibroblasts. CSE induced Smad3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in HFL-1 cells. Silencing of Smad3 by siRNA not only eliminated the stimulatory effect of CSE on VEGF release but also inhibited baseline VEGF production. Suppression of TbetaR1 by the pharmacological inhibitor (SB431542) markedly reduced VEGF release by HFL-1 in response to CSE and this effect was confirmed by TbetaR1 siRNA. In contrast, nicotine inhibited VEGF release by HFL-1 in a dose and time dependent manner. Our findings indicate that CSE stimulates Smad3-mediated VEGF release by lung fibroblasts. Nicotine does not account for the CSE stimulation of VEGF in HFL-1. The ability of lung fibroblasts to produce VEGF may play a role in pathogenesis of cigarette smoke induced lung disease.

23623838|t|Maternal nicotine exposure during lactation alters hypothalamic neuropeptides expression in the adult rat progeny.
23623838|a|Maternal exposure to nicotine during lactation causes hyperleptinemia in the pups and, at adulthood, these animals are overweight and hyperleptinemic, while, in their hypothalamus, the leptin signaling pathway is reduced, evidencing a central leptin resistance. Then, we evaluated the expression of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and others in different hypothalamic nuclei in order to better understand the mechanisms underlying the obese phenotype observed in these animals at adulthood. On the 2nd postnatal day (P2), dams were subcutaneously implanted with osmotic minipumps releasing nicotine (NIC-6 mg/kg/day) or saline for 14 days. Offspring were killed in P180 and immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis were carried out. Significance data had p&lt;0.05. Adult NIC offspring showed more intense NPY staining in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) (+21%) and increased number of POMC-positive cells in the: arcuate nucleus (+33%), as an increase in fiber density of alpha-MSH in PVN (+85%). However, the number of CART-positive cells was reduced in the PVN (-25%). CRH staining was more intense in NIC offspring (+136%). Orexins and AgRP were not altered. Thus, maternal nicotine exposure changes hypothalamic neuropeptides in the adult progeny that is partially compatible with leptin resistance.

23625910|t|Effect of paraoxonase 1 192 Q/R polymorphism on paraoxonase and acetylcholinesterase enzyme activities in a Turkish population exposed to organophosphate.
23625910|a|Organophosphate (OP) compounds are the most commonly used pesticide groups and they are commercially used in the market for local and industrial purposes. Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) enzyme plays an important role in biotransformation of OP compounds, which shows toxic effects via inhibiting the acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The aim of this study was to determine the effects of PON1 gene polymorphism and its effects on PON and AChE enzyme activities in individuals who were exposed to organophosphorus insecticides due to occupational reasons, and to profile the probability of susceptibility to organophosphorus compounds. For this purpose, 54 individuals who were exposed to OPs and 54 healthy unrelated controls were studied. First, PON1 and AChE enzyme activities were measured. Second, PON1 192 Q/R polymorphism was determined by standard polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. When the PON1 192 Q/R polymorphism was compared with PON1 enzyme activities, statistically significant association was found in both OP-exposed and control groups (p &lt; 0.05). PON1 192 R(+) (QR + RR genotypes) genotype carriers had higher PON1 activities than 192 R(-) (QQ) genotype carriers. On the other hand, results were statistically analyzed in terms of AChE enzyme activities and there were statistically significant differences only in the OP-exposed group (p &lt; 0.05). The mean AChE concentration in the OP-exposed group was determined as 33.79 +- 6.84 U/g haemoglobin (Hb) for PON1 192 R(+) carriers and 30.37 +- 7.62 U/g Hb for PON1 192 R(+) carriers. As a conclusion, PON1 and AChE activities were increasing according to the genotypes found in individuals having been exposed to OPs at a chronic level; 192 R(+) &gt; 192 R(-), respectively.

23628791|t|Down-regulation of LRRK2 in control and DAT transfected HEK cells increases manganese-induced oxidative stress and cell toxicity.
23628791|a|The extra-pyramidal symptoms associated with manganism often overlap with that seen in Parkinsonism suggesting a common link between the two disorders. Since wide deviations are observed in susceptibility and characteristics of the symptoms observed in manganism, these differences may be due to underlying genetic variability. Genes linked to early onset of Parkinsonism which includes ATP13A2 and parkin have already been suggested to promote development of Mn toxicity. Of the other Parkinson-linked genes, mutations in LRRK2, an autosomal dominant gene, represent another likely candidate involved in the development of manganism. In this paper the effect of shRNA LRRK2 knock-down on Mn toxicity was examined in control and DAT transfected HEK293 cells. Results demonstrate that LRRK2 down-regulation potentiates Mn toxicity in both control and DAT-transfected cell as well as potentiates DA toxicity. Combined treatment of Mn and DA further augments cell toxicity, ROS production and JNK phosphorylation in LRRK2 deficient cells compared to controls. Consistent with studies demonstrating that LRRK2 plays a role in the phosphorylation of p38, our results similarly demonstrate a decrease in p38 activation in LRRK2 knock-down cells. Our findings suggest that null mutations in LRRK2 which cause Parkinsonism potentiate Mn toxicity and increase susceptibility to develop manganism.

23629516|t|In Ovo effects of two organophosphate flame retardants--TCPP and TDCPP--on pipping success, development, mRNA expression, and thyroid hormone levels in chicken embryos.
23629516|a|Tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCPP) and tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP) are organic flame retardants detected in the environment and biota for which avian toxicological data are limited. In this study, domestic chicken eggs were injected with TCPP or TDCPP (maximum dose = 51,600 and 45,000ng/g egg, respectively) to determine dose-dependent effects on pipping success, development, hepatic messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of genes associated with xenobiotic metabolism and the thyroid hormone (TH) pathway, and TH levels following 20-22 days of incubation. Neither compound reduced pipping success; however, TCPP significantly delayed pipping at 9240 and 51,600ng/g and reduced tarsus length at 51,600ng/g. TDCPP exposure resulted in significant decreases in head plus bill length, embryo mass, and gallbladder size at 45,000ng/g and reduced plasma free T4 levels at 7640ng/g. Type I deiodinase, liver fatty acid-binding protein, and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A37 mRNA levels were significantly induced by TCPP, whereas TDCPP induced CYP3A37 and CYP2H1. Chemical analysis of egg contents at incubation days 0, 5, 11, 18, and 19 revealed that &gt; 92% of the injected TCPP or TDCPP concentration was detectable up to day 5; however, &lt; 1% was detected by day 19. The observed phenotypic responses to TCPP and TDCPP exposure may be associated with disruption of the TH axis, which is critical for normal growth and development in birds. The effects of TDCPP on the gallbladder indicate that the disturbance of lipid metabolism is a likely mechanism of toxicity.

23639586|t|Gene expression profiling and pathway analysis of hepatotoxicity induced by triptolide in Wistar rats.
23639586|a|Triptolide (TP), a major component of TWHF, is widely used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, nephritis and leprosy. However, its clinical use is limited by hepatotoxicity. To further elucidate the underlying mechanism of its hepatotoxic effects, hepatic gene expression profiles were analyzed. TP (1000 and 300 mug/kg) was orally administered to Wistar rats for 14 days. Current study indicated that female rats were more sensitive to TP-induced hepatotoxicity than males. Genome-wide microarray analyses identified 3329 differentially expressed genes in liver of female rats. Analyses of these genes identified over-represented functions associated with insulin signaling pathway, glucose metabolism, cell cycle, oxidative stress and apoptosis, which were consistent with the results of significant increase of Caspase-3 activity and reduction of serum glucose, GSH/GSSG ratio, glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activities, liver glycogen. In addition, it was observed for the first time that glucocorticoids and IGF1 might get involved in TP-induced hepatotoxicity. These data suggest that TP treatment could alter the hepatic redox status, reduce serum glucose and induce hepatocyte apoptosis, consistent with the differential expression of genes involved in insulin signaling pathway, glucose metabolism pathway and cell stress pathway, all of which might contribute to the overall TP-induced hepatotoxicity.

23643483|t|Interactive effects of smoking and glutathione S-transferase polymorphisms on the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
23643483|a|Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) protect cells against exogenous and endogenous oxidative stress. GST polymorphisms are associated with the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes mellitus (DM), especially in current-smokers. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a predictor of future CVD or DM, because oxidative stress contributes to their pathogenesis. This study investigated whether the combination of smoking status and GST genotypes could affect the risk for NAFLD. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted among 713 Japanese participants (458 males and 255 females) during a health screening program. The GSTM1 null, GSTT1 null, GSTP1 A/B or B/B and GSTA1 A/B or B/B genotypes were determined and deemed to be high-risk genotypes. The prevalence of NAFLD was 18.7%. Among never-smokers, carriers of one, and those of two or more high-risk GSTM1, GSTP1 or GSTA1 genotypes were at a higher risk for NAFLD than those who were not carriers [odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 2.6 (1.1-5.9) and 3.3 (1.3-8.1), respectively], and the risk was further increased among current-smokers [4.6 (1.6-13.0) and 5.4 (1.2-23.7), respectively]. This is the first report to show that the combination of current-smoking and harboring high-risk GSTM1, GSTP1 and/or GSTA1 genotypes is interactively associated with the risk of NAFLD.

23643828|t|The C1 domain-targeted isophthalate derivative HMI-1b11 promotes neurite outgrowth and GAP-43 expression through PKCalpha activation in SH-SY5Y cells.
23643828|a|Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of serine/threonine phosphotransferases ubiquitously expressed and involved in multiple cellular functions, such as proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. The C1 domain of PKC represents an attractive drug target, especially for developing PKC activators. Dialkyl 5-(hydroxymethyl)isophthalates are a novel group of synthetic C1 domain ligands that exhibit antiproliferative effect in HeLa cervical carcinoma cells. Here we selected two isophthalates, HMI-1a3 and HMI-1b11, and characterized their effects in the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. Both of the active isophthalates exhibited significant antiproliferative and differentiation-inducing effects. Since HMI-1b11 did not impair cell survival even at the highest concentration tested (20muM), and supported neurite growth and differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells, we focused on studying its downstream signaling cascades and effects on gene expression. Consistently, genome-wide gene expression microarray and gene set enrichment analysis indicated that HMI-1b11 (10muM) induced changes in genes mainly related to cell differentiation. In particular, further studies revealed that HMI-1b11 exposure induced up-regulation of GAP-43, a marker for neurite sprouting and neuronal differentiation. These effects were induced by a 7-min HMI-1b11 treatment and specifically depended on PKCalpha activation, since pretreatment with the selective inhibitor Go6976 abolished the up-regulation of GAP-43 protein observed at 12h. In parallel, we found that a 7-min exposure to HMI-1b11 induced PKCalpha accumulation to the cytoskeleton, an effect that was again prevented by pretreatment with Go6976. Despite similar binding affinities to PKC, the isophthalates had different effects on PKC-dependent ERK1/2 signaling: HMI-1a3-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was transient, while HMI-1b11 induced a rapid but prolonged ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Overall our data are in accordance with previous studies showing that activation of the PKCalpha and ERK1/2 pathways participate in regulating neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, since PKC has been classified as one of the cognitive kinases, and activation of PKC is considered a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cognitive disorders, our findings suggest that HMI-1b11 represents a promising lead compound in research aimed to prevent or counteract memory impairment.

29883990|t|Assessment of Cannabinoids Agonist and Antagonist in Invasion Potential of K562 Cancer Cells
29883990|a|Background: The prominent hallmark of malignancies is the metastatic spread of cancer cells. Recent studies have reported that the nature of invasive cells could be changed after this phenomenon, causing chemotherapy resistance. It has been demonstrated that the up-regulated expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2/MMP-9, as a metastasis biomarker, can fortify the metastatic potential of leukemia. Furthermore, investigations have confirmed the inhibitory effect of cannabinoid and endocannabinoid on the proliferation of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Methods: In the present study, the inhibitory effect of WIN 55212-2 (a CB1/CB2 receptor agonist) and AM251 (a selective CB1 receptor antagonist) on K562 cells, as a chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) model, was evaluated using MTT and invasion assay. Expressions of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were then assessed by Western blot analysis. Results: The data obtained from MTT assay showed that WIN 55212-2 could attenuate cell proliferation; however, AM251 was less effective in this regard. Our results showed that WIN 55212-2 considerably reduced cancer cell invasiveness, while AM251 exhibited a converse effect. Moreover, CB1 activation resulted in decreased expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Conclusion: Our findings clarifies that CB1 receptors are responsible for anti-invasive effects in the K562 cell line.

29953732|t|Vitamin D3 supplementation improves testicular function in diabetic rats through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma/transforming growth factor-beta 1/nuclear factor-kappa B.
29953732|a|AIMS/INTRODUCTION: Vitamin D3 deficiency can lead to male hypogonadism in diabetes mellitus, but the target organs and the mechanism driving the disorder are unclear. This experiment was designed to study the relationship between vitamin D3 deficiency and hypogonadism in diabetes mellitus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes were randomly divided into four groups and treated with different doses of vitamin D3 : blank (no vitamin D3 ), low (0.025 mug/kg/day), high (0.1 mug/kg/day), high (0.1 mug/kg/day) and with bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma inhibitor 30 mg/kg/day). They were compared with wild-type rats. RESULTS: After 12 weeks, the vitamin D3 supplements had partially restored testicular pathological changes, as shown by reduced testicular fibrosis related to downregulation transforming growth factor beta 1 and apoptosis related to downregulation of nuclear factor kappa B, but not the pituitary gland. The expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, which can inhibit transforming growth factor beta 1 and nuclear factor kappa B, was significantly increased after treatment with vitamin D3 . CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that treatment with vitamin D3 can improve testicular function in diabetic rats through the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma/transforming growth factor beta 1/nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway.

30074247|t|Effects of non-euphoric plant cannabinoids on muscle quality and performance of dystrophic mdx mice.
30074247|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), caused by dystrophin deficiency, results in chronic inflammation and irreversible skeletal muscle degeneration. Moreover, the associated impairment of autophagy greatly contributes to the aggravation of muscle damage. We explored the possibility of using non-euphoric compounds present in Cannabis sativa, cannabidiol (CBD), cannabidivarin (CBDV) and tetrahydrocannabidivarin (THCV), to reduce inflammation, restore functional autophagy and positively enhance muscle function in vivo. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Using quantitative PCR, western blots and [Ca2+ ]i measurements, we explored the effects of CBD and CBDV on the differentiation of both murine and human skeletal muscle cells as well as their potential interaction with TRP channels. Male dystrophic mdx mice were injected i.p. with CBD or CBDV at different stages of the disease. After treatment, locomotor tests and biochemical analyses were used to evaluate their effects on inflammation and autophagy. KEY RESULTS: CBD and CBDV promoted the differentiation of murine C2C12 myoblast cells into myotubes by increasing [Ca2+ ]i mostly via TRPV1 activation, an effect that undergoes rapid desensitization. In primary satellite cells and myoblasts isolated from healthy and/or DMD donors, not only CBD and CBDV but also THCV promoted myotube formation, in this case, mostly via TRPA1 activation. In mdx mice, CBD (60 mg kg-1 ) and CBDV (60 mg kg-1 ) prevented the loss of locomotor activity, reduced inflammation and restored autophagy. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: We provide new insights into plant cannabinoid interactions with TRP channels in skeletal muscle, highlighting a potential opportunity for novel co-adjuvant therapies to prevent muscle degeneration in DMD patients.

30145802|t|AZD9291 promotes autophagy and inhibits PI3K/Akt pathway in NSCLC cancer cells.
30145802|a|AZD9291, a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), is highly selective against EGFR T790M-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). On investigating the growth inhibitory effects of AZD9291 on NSCLC and the underlying mechanism, we found that AZD9291 can trigger autophagy-mediated cell death in both A549 and H1975 cells by increasing the expression of phosphatidylethanolamine-modified microtubule-associated protein light-chain 3 (LC3) and decreasing the expression of p62. In the presence of the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine, the AZD9291-induced increase in LC3 level was further augmented. AZD9291 decreased the levels of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (Akt), and phosphorylated Akt. AZD9291-induced cell death was enhanced by Akt knockdown, and the levels of both EGFR and phosphorylated EGFR were decreased by AZD9291. AZD9291 was also found to significantly suppress the tumor growth in H1975 xenograft nude mice. Thus, AZD9291 was found to induce autophagy, decrease in EGFR levels, and show a strong inhibitory effect on NSCLC both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was found to play a critical role in AZD9291-induced cell death.

30203000|t|Evidence for Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor-Mediated Inhibition of Osteoblast Differentiation in Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells.
30203000|a|Multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) maintain the ability to differentiate into adipogenic, chondrogenic, or osteogenic cell lineages. There is increasing concern that exposure to environmental agents such as aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligands, may perturb the osteogenic pathways responsible for normal bone formation. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the potential of the prototypic AhR ligand 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) to disrupt osteogenic differentiation of human bone-derived MSCs (hBMSCs) in vitro. Primary hBMSCs from three donors were exposed to 10 nM TCDD and differentiation was interrogated using select histological, biochemical, and transcriptional markers of osteogenesis. Exposure to 10 nM TCDD resulted in an overall consistent attenuation of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and matrix mineralization at terminal stages of differentiation in primary hBMSCs. At the transcriptional level, the transcriptional regulator DLX5 and additional osteogenic markers (ALP, OPN, and IBSP) displayed attenuated expression; conversely, FGF9 and FGF18 were consistently upregulated in each donor. Expression of stem cell potency markers SOX2, NANOG, and SALL4 decreased in the osteogenic controls, whereas expression in TCDD-treated cells resembled that of undifferentiated cells. Coexposure with the AhR antagonist GNF351 blocked TCDD-mediated attenuation of matrix mineralization, and either fully or partially rescued expression of genes associated with osteogenic regulation, extracellular matrix, and/or maintenance of multipotency. Thus, experimental evidence from this study suggests that AhR transactivation likely attenuates osteoblast differentiation in multipotent hBMSCs. This study also underscores the use of primary human MSCs to evaluate osteoinductive or osteotoxic potential of chemical and pharmacologic agents in vitro.

30209975|t|Thyroid hormone (T3) stimulates brown adipose tissue activation via mitochondrial biogenesis and MTOR-mediated mitophagy.
30209975|a|The thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3) activates thermogenesis by uncoupling electron transport from ATP synthesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT) mitochondria. Although T3 can induce thermogenesis by sympathetic innervation, little is known about its cell autonomous effects on BAT mitochondria. We thus examined effects of T3 on mitochondrial activity, autophagy, and metabolism in primary brown adipocytes and BAT and found that T3 increased fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial respiration as well as autophagic flux, mitophagy, and mitochondrial biogenesis. Interestingly, there was no significant induction of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) despite high mitochondrial respiration and UCP1 induction by T3. However, when cells were treated with Atg5 siRNA to block autophagy, induction of mitochondrial respiration by T3 decreased, and was accompanied by ROS accumulation, demonstrating a critical role for autophagic mitochondrial turnover. We next generated an Atg5 conditional knockout mouse model (Atg5 cKO) by injecting Ucp1 promoter-driven Cre-expressing adenovirus into Atg5Flox/Flox mice to examine effects of BAT-specific autophagy on thermogenesis in vivo. Hyperthyroid Atg5 cKO mice exhibited lower body temperature than hyperthyroid or euthyroid control mice. Metabolomic analysis showed that T3 increased short and long chain acylcarnitines in BAT, consistent with increased beta-oxidation. T3 also decreased amino acid levels, and in conjunction with SIRT1 activation, decreased MTOR activity to stimulate autophagy. In summary, T3 has direct effects on mitochondrial autophagy, activity, and turnover in BAT that are essential for thermogenesis. Stimulation of BAT activity by thyroid hormone or its analogs may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for obesity and metabolic diseases.

30215777|t|Nrf2 Activation Ameliorates Hepatotoxicity Induced by a Heme Synthesis Inhibitor.
30215777|a|Transcription factor Nrf2 protects hepatocytes against various toxicants by upregulating cytoprotective genes. The heme synthesis inhibitor 3, 5-diethoxycarbonyl-1, 4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) leads to liver injury around the portal vein, unlike other groups of toxicants that cause hemorrhage and necrosis in the centrilobular area. To examine whether and how Nrf2 protects livers from the injury, we fed DDC to Nrf2 knockout (Nrf2KO), wild-type (WT), Keap1flox/flox (Keap1-knockdown; Keap1KD), and liver-specific Keap1 knockout (Keap1-Alb) mice, as these lines of mice exhibit stepwise increases in Nrf2 protein expression levels. Liver-specific Keap1::Nrf2 double-knockout (Keap1::Nrf2-Alb) mice were also exploited to examine the contribution of Nrf2. Two weeks after DDC feeding, Keap1-Alb mice were fully recovered from body weight loss, but the WT and Nrf2KO mice were not. The liver-to-body-weight ratio of Keap1-Alb mice was significantly larger than that of WT and Nrf2KO mice. Two indicators of hepatotoxicity, alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin in plasma, were both elevated in WT mice, but downregulated in Keap1-Alb mice after the DDC-feeding. DDC-induced porphyrin accumulation was reduced in the livers of Keap1-Alb and Keap1KD mice compared with that of WT mice. When assessed by the Nqo1 level, Nrf2 expression was further enhanced by DDC in Keap1-Alb mice, suggesting that DDC may have a Keap1 independent potential to activate Nrf2. Genetic activation of Nrf2 in Keap1-Alb mice increased the extracellular excretion of porphyrins, but contrary to our expectation, hepatic damages in Nrf2KO mice appeared to be similar to that of WT mice. Based on these observations, we conclude that Nrf2 activation protects livers against DDC-elicited hepatotoxicity.

30236862|t|The PPARGC1A locus and CNS-specific PGC-1alpha isoforms are associated with Parkinson's Disease.
30236862|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide. PGC-1alpha, encoded by PPARGC1A, is a transcriptional co-activator that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. We recently discovered multiple new PPARGC1A transcripts that initiate from a novel promoter located far upstream of the reference gene promoter, are CNS-specific and are more abundant than reference gene transcripts in whole brain. These CNS-specific transcripts encode two main full-length and several truncated isoforms via alternative splicing. Truncated CNS-isoforms include 17 kDa proteins that lack the second LXXLL motif serving as an interaction site for several nuclear receptors. We now determined expression levels of CNS- and reference gene transcripts in 5 brain regions of 21, 8, and 13 deceased subjects with idiopathic PD, Lewy body dementia and controls without neurodegenerative disorders, respectively. We observed reductions of CNS-specific transcripts (encoding full-length isoforms) only in the substantia nigra pars compacta of PD and Lewy body dementia. However, in the substantia nigra and globus pallidus of PD cases we found an up-regulation of transcripts encoding the 17 kDa proteins that inhibited the co-activation of several transcription factors by full-length PGC-1alpha proteins in transfection assays. In two established animal models of PD, the PPARGC1A expression profiles differed from the profile in human PD in that the levels of CNS- and reference gene transcripts were decreased in several brain regions. Furthermore, we identified haplotypes in the CNS-specific region of PPARGC1A that appeared protective for PD in a clinical cohort and a post-mortem sample (P = .0002). Thus, functional and genetic studies support a role of the CNS-specific PPARGC1A locus in PD.

30247711|t|Employing Dietary Comparators to Perform Risk Assessments for Anti-Androgens Without Using Animal Data.
30247711|a|This study investigated the use of androgen receptor (AR) reporter gene assay data in a non-animal exposure-led risk assessment in which in vitro anti-androgenic activity and exposure data were put into context using a naturally occurring comparator substance with a history of dietary consumption. First, several dietary components were screened to identify which selectively interfered with AR signaling in vitro, using the AR CALUX  test. The IC50 values from these dose-response data together with measured or predicted human exposure levels were used to calculate exposure: activity ratios (EARs) for the dietary components and a number of other well-known anti-androgenic substances. Both diindolylmethane (DIM) and resveratrol are specifically acting dietary anti-androgens. The EARs for several anti-androgens were therefore expressed relative to the EAR of DIM, and how this 'dietary comparator ratio' (DCR) approach may be used to make safety decisions was assessed using an exposure-led case study for an anti-androgenic botanical ingredient. This highlights a pragmatic approach which allows novel chemical exposures to be put into context against dietary exposures to natural anti-androgenic substances. The DCR approach may have utility for other modes of action where appropriate comparators can be identified.

30259626|t|Aberrant methylation-induced dysfunction of p16 is associated with osteoblast activation caused by fluoride.
30259626|a|Chronic exposure to fluoride continues to be a public health problem worldwide, affecting thousands of people. Fluoride can cause abnormal proliferation and activation of osteoblast and osteoclast, leading to skeletal fluorosis that can cause pain and harm to joints and bones and even lead to permanent disability. Nevertheless, there is no recognized mechanism to explain the bone lesions of fluorosis. In this work, we performed a population study and in vitro experiments to investigate the pathogenic mechanism of skeletal fluorosis in relation to methylation of the promoter of p16. The protein coded by the p16 gene inhibits cdk (cyclin-dependent kinase) 4/cdk6-mediated phosphorylation4 of retinoblastoma gene product and induces cell cycle arrest. The results showed that hypermethylation of p16 and reduced gene expression was evident in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with fluorosis and correlated with the level of fluoride exposure. Studies with cell cultures of osteoblasts revealed in response to sodium fluoride (NaF) treatment, there was an induction of p16 hypermethylation and decreased expression, leading to increased cell proliferation, a longer S-phase of the cell cycle, and development of skeletal fluorosis. Further, the methylation inhibitor, 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine, reversed the p16 hypermethylation and expression in response to NaF. These results reveal a regulatory role of p16 gene methylation on osteoblasts activation during the development of skeletal fluorosis.

30280499|t|Application of an activity-based receptor bioassay to investigate the in vitro activity of selected indole- and indazole-3-carboxamide-based synthetic cannabinoids at CB1 and CB2 receptors.
30280499|a|Synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) are the most chemically diverse group of new psychoactive substances. This group has been associated with several intoxications, many with fatal outcomes. Although advancements have been achieved in pharmacology, metabolism, and detection of these compounds in recent years, these aspects are still unresolved for many SCs. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro potency of 14 indole- and indazole-based SCs by applying a stable CB1 or CB2 receptor activation assay and correlating the activity with their structure. The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50 ) of 5-chloropentyl, 5-bromopentyl, and 5-iodopentyl JWH-122 analogs varied from 74.1 to 283.7 nM for CB1 and 7.05 to 23.4 nM for CB2, where the addition of a chlorine atom enhanced the potency at CB1 compared with the bromo and iodo analogs. AM-2201 was the most active at CB1 within this naphthoylindole family, with an EC50 of 23.5 nM but with the lowest efficacy (Emax 98.8%). Within the indole-3-carboxamide derivatives, 5F-MDMB-PICA was the most active compound, with a CB1/CB2 EC50 of 3.26/0.87 nM and an Emax around three times higher than JWH-018. ADB-FUBINACA was the most potent tested SC overall, with a CB1/CB2 EC50 of 0.69/0.59 nM, and an Emax around 3-fold higher than that for JWH-018 at CB1. The data obtained in this study confirm how small differences in the structure of SCs might lead to large differences in their activity, especially at CB1, which may be correlated with differences in their toxic effects in humans.

30283037|t|Adolescent exposure to Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol alters the transcriptional trajectory and dendritic architecture of prefrontal pyramidal neurons.
30283037|a|Neuronal circuits within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) mediate higher cognitive functions and emotional regulation that are disrupted in psychiatric disorders. The PFC undergoes significant maturation during adolescence, a period when cannabis use in humans has been linked to subsequent vulnerability to psychiatric disorders such as addiction and schizophrenia. Here, we investigated in a rat model the effects of adolescent exposure to Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a psychoactive component of cannabis, on the morphological architecture and transcriptional profile of layer III pyramidal neurons-using cell type- and layer-specific high-resolution microscopy, laser capture microdissection and next-generation RNA-sequencing. The results confirmed known normal expansions in basal dendritic arborization and dendritic spine pruning during the transition from late adolescence to early adulthood that were accompanied by differential expression of gene networks associated with neurodevelopment in control animals. In contrast, THC exposure disrupted the normal developmental process by inducing premature pruning of dendritic spines and allostatic atrophy of dendritic arborization in early adulthood. Surprisingly, there was minimal overlap of the developmental transcriptomes between THC- and vehicle-exposed rats. THC altered functional gene networks related to cell morphogenesis, dendritic development, and cytoskeleton organization. Marked developmental network disturbances were evident for epigenetic regulators with enhanced co-expression of chromatin- and dendrite-related genes in THC-treated animals. Dysregulated PFC co-expression networks common to both the THC-treated animals and patients with schizophrenia were enriched for cytoskeletal and neurite development. Overall, adolescent THC exposure altered the morphological and transcriptional trajectory of PFC pyramidal neurons, which could enhance vulnerability to psychiatric disorders.

30296409|t|PARP inhibition induces Akt-mediated cytoprotective effects through the formation of a mitochondria-targeted phospho-ATM-NEMO-Akt-mTOR signalosome.
30296409|a|PURPOSE: The cytoprotective effect of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibition is well documented in various cell types subjected to oxidative stress. Previously, we have demonstrated that PARP1 inhibition activates Akt, and showed that this response plays a critical role in the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity and in cell survival. However, it has not yet been defined how nuclear PARP1 signals to cytoplasmic Akt. METHODS: WRL 68, HeLa and MCF7 cells were grown in culture. Oxidative stress was induced with hydrogen peroxide. PARP was inhibited with the PARP inhibitor PJ34. ATM, mTOR- and NEMO were silenced using specific siRNAs. Cell viability assays were based on the MTT assay. PARP-ATM pulldown experiments were conducted; each protein was visualized by Western blotting. Immunoprecipitation of ATM, phospho-ATM and NEMO was performed from cytoplasmic and mitochondrial cell fractions and proteins were detected by Western blotting. In some experiments, a continually active Akt construct was introduced. Nuclear to cytoplasmic and mitochondrial translocation of phospho-Akt was visualized by confocal microscopy. RESULTS: Here we present evidence for a PARP1 mediated, PARylation-dependent interaction between ATM and NEMO, which is responsible for the cytoplasmic transport of phosphorylated (thus, activated) ATM kinase. In turn, the cytoplasmic p-ATM and NEMO forms complex with mTOR and Akt, yielding the phospho-ATM-NEMO-Akt-mTOR signalosome, which is responsible for the PARP-inhibition induced Akt activation. The phospho-ATM-NEMO-Akt-mTOR signalosome localizes to the mitochondria and is essential for the PARP-inhibition-mediated cytoprotective effects in oxidatively stressed cells. When the formation of the signalosome is prevented, the cytoprotective effects diminish, but cells can be rescued by constantly active Akt1, further confirming the critical role of Akt activation in cytoprotection. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the data presented in the current paper are consistent with the hypothesis that PARP inhibition suppresses the PARylation of ATM, which, in turn, forms an ATM-NEMO complex, which exits the nucleus, and combines in the cytosol with mTOR and Act, resulting in Act phosphorylation (i.e. activation), which, in turn, produces the cytoprotective action via the induction of Akt-mediated survival pathways. This mechanism can be important in the protective effect of PARP inhibitor in various diseases associated with oxidative stress. Moreover, disruption of the formation or action of the phospho-ATM-NEMO-Akt-mTOR signalosome may offer potential future experimental therapeutic checkpoints.

30303745|t|Bisphenol A exposure alters placentation and causes preeclampsia-like features in pregnant mice involved in reprogramming of DNA methylation of WNT2.
30303745|a|Preeclampsia leads to adverse outcomes for pregnant women. Bisphenol A (BPA) is an environmental endocrine disruptor and has been shown to be positively associated with increased risk of preeclampsia in human studies. We investigated whether BPA exposure causes preeclampsia-like features in pregnant mice and the associated underlying mechanisms. Experiments were performed in animal models and cell cultures. In pregnant mice, BPA-exposed mice exhibited preeclampsia-like features including hypertension, disruption of the circulation, and the placental angiogenesis biomarkers fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 and placenta growth factor, and glomerular atrophy; urinary protein was not affected. These preeclampsia-like features correlated with increased retention of smooth muscle cells and reduced vessel areas at the junctional zone of the placenta. In addition, there were disrupted expression of invasion-related genes including increased tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, decreased metalloproteinases, and Wnt family member WNT2/beta-catenin, which correlated with increased DNA methylation in its promoter region and upregulation of DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt)1. BPA exposure impeded the interaction between the human cytotrophoblast cell line, HTR-8/SVneo, and endothelium cells. BPA exposure down-regulated WNT2 expression, and elevated the DNA methylation of WNT2; these results were consistent with in vivo observations. Inhibition of DNMT in HTR-8/SVneo cells resulted in reduced DNA methylation and increased expression of WNT2. Taken together, these data demonstrate that BPA exposure alters trophoblast cell invasion and causes abnormal placental vessel remodeling, both of which lead to the development of preeclampsia-like features in pregnant mice. Our results suggest that this phenomenon involves the epigenetic reprogramming and down-regulation of WNT2 mediated by DNMT1.-Ye, Y., Tang, Y., Xiong, Y., Feng, L., Li, X. Bisphenol A exposure alters placentation and causes preeclampsia-like features in pregnant mice involved in reprogramming of DNA methylation of WNT2.

30322873|t|Pyrimidinyl Biphenylureas Act as Allosteric Modulators to Activate Cannabinoid Receptor 1 and Initiate beta-Arrestin-Dependent Responses.
30322873|a|Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that is abundant in the central nervous system. It binds several compounds in its orthosteric site, including the endocannabinoids, arachidonoyl ethanolamide (anandamide) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol, and the plant-derived Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol, one of the main psychoactive components of marijuana. It primarily couples to Gi/o proteins to inhibit adenylate cyclase activity and typically induces downstream signaling that is Gi-dependent. Since this receptor is implicated in several maladies, such as obesity, pain, and neurodegenerative disorders, there is interest in developing therapeutics that selectively target this receptor. Allosteric modulators of CB1 offer one new approach that has tremendous therapeutic potential. Here, we reveal receptor- and cellular-level properties consistent with receptor activation by a series of pyrimidinyl biphenylureas (LDK1285, LDK1288, LDK1305, and PSNCBAM1), including promoting binding of the agonist CP55940 with positive cooperativity and inhibiting binding of the inverse agonist SR141716A with negative cooperativity, demonstrated via radioligand binding studies. Consistent with these findings, the allosteric modulators induced cellular internalization of the receptor and recruitment of beta-arrestin 2 in human embryonic kidney cell line 293 cells monitored with confocal and total internal reflective fluorescence microscopy, respectively. These allosteric modulators, however, caused G-protein-independent but beta-arrestin 1-dependent phosphorylation of the downstream kinases extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and Src, shown by immunoblotting studies. These results are consistent with the involvement of beta-arrestin and suggest that these allosteric modulators induce biased signaling.

30327826|t|Benzene metabolite 1,2,4-benzenetriol changes DNA methylation and histone acetylation of erythroid-specific genes in K562 cells.
30327826|a|1,2,4-Benzenetriol (BT) is one of the phenolic metabolites of benzene, a general occupational hazard and ubiquitous environmental air pollutant with leukemogenic potential in humans. Previous studies have revealed that the benzene metabolites phenol and hydroquinone can inhibit hemin-induced erythroid differentiation in K562 cells. We investigated the roles of DNA methylation and histone acetylation in BT-inhibited erythroid differentiation in K562 cells. When K562 cells were treated with 0, 5, 10, 15 or 20 microM BT for 72 h, hemin-induced hemoglobin synthesis decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. Both 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR, DNA methyltransferase inhibitor) and trichostatin A (TSA, histone deacetylases inhibitor) could prevent 20 microM BT from inhibiting hemin-induced hemoglobin synthesis and the mRNA expression of erythroid genes. Exposure to BT changed DNA methylation levels at several CpG sites of erythroid-specific genes, as well as the acetylation of histone H3 and H4, chromatin occupancy of GATA-1 and recruitment of RNA polymerase II at alpha-globin and beta-globin gene clusters after hemin induction. These results demonstrated that BT could inhibit hemin-induced erythroid differentiation, where DNA methylation and histone acetylation also played important roles by down-regulating erythroid-specific genes. This partly explained the mechanisms of benzene hematotoxicity.

30329025|t|Endometriotic inflammatory microenvironment induced by macrophages can be targeted by niclosamide .
30329025|a|Endometriosis causes severe chronic pelvic pain and infertility. We have recently reported that niclosamide treatment reduces growth and progression of endometriosis-like lesions and inflammatory signaling (NF${\rm \small K}$B and STAT3) in a mouse model. In the present study, we examined further inhibitory mechanisms by which niclosamide affects endometriotic lesions using an endometriotic epithelial cell line, 12Z, and macrophages differentiated from a monocytic THP-1 cell line. Niclosamide dose dependently reduced 12Z viability, reduced STAT3 and NF${\rm \small K}$B activity, and increased both cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP. To model the inflammatory microenvironment in endometriotic lesions, we exposed 12Z cells to macrophage conditioned media (CM). Macrophages were differentiated from THP-1 cells using 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate as M0, and then M0 macrophages were polarized into M1 or M2 using LPS/IFNgamma or IL4/IL13, respectively. Conditioned media from M0, M1, or M2 cultures increased 12Z viability. This effect was blocked by niclosamide, and cell viability returned to that of CM from cells treated with niclosamide alone. To assess proteins targeted by niclosamide in 12Z cells, CM from 12Z cells cultured with M0, M1, or M2 with/without niclosamide were analyzed by cytokine/chemokine protein array kits. Conditioned media from M0, M1, and/or M2 stimulated the secretion of cytokines/chemokines from 12Z cells. Production of most of these secreted cytokines/chemokines in 12Z cells was inhibited by niclosamide. Knockdown of each gene in 12Z cells using siRNA resulted in reduced cell viability. These results indicate that niclosamide can inhibit the inflammatory factors in endometriotic epithelial cells stimulated by macrophages by targeting STAT3 and/or NF${\rm \small K}$B signaling.

30336226|t|Nonatopic eczema in elderly women: Effect of air pollution and genes.
30336226|a|BACKGROUND: Although many risk factors have been described for atopic eczema in children, little is known about the eczema phenotype in middle-aged or elderly adults. OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine the association between air pollution, atopy, and eczema in adulthood. METHODS: This analysis was based on 834 women from the Study on the influence of Air pollution on Lung Function, Inflammation and Ageing cohort in Germany. Incident symptoms of eczema after age 55 years and prevalent symptoms of eczema 12 months or less before investigation were assessed by means of questionnaire at the second follow-up (2007-2010). Total serum IgE levels were measured at baseline (1985-1994) and in 2007-2010. Exposure to air pollution was assessed by using land-use regression. Adjusted logistic regression models were applied to estimate the association between air pollution and incident and prevalent symptoms of eczema. Weighted genetic risk scores were used to investigate the effect of atopic eczema-related risk alleles on this association. RESULTS: Exposures to oxides of nitrogen (nitrogen dioxide and nitrogen oxides) and particulate matter (fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of &lt;=2.5 mum [PM2.5] and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of &lt;10 mum) were significantly associated with increased odds of incident eczema (eg, with PM2.5 per 4.7 mug/m3; odds ratio, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.06-1.99). These associations were slightly more pronounced with nonatopic eczema (eg, with PM2.5; odds ratio of 1.65 and 95% CI of 1.15-2.34 for participants without hay fever or increased IgE levels). Associations with air pollution were stronger in carriers of fewer risk alleles for atopic eczema. CONCLUSION: Nonatopic eczema in the elderly is associated with traffic-related air pollutants, and this phenotype differs from genetically driven atopic eczema.

30342015|t|Capsaicin is beneficial to hyperlipidemia, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and atherosclerosis in Guinea pigs fed on a high-fat diet.
30342015|a|Capsaicin has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, as well as some benefits on the cardiovascular system. The exact effects of capsaicin on atherosclerosis are poorly understood. To investigate the effects of capsaicin on hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis in guinea pigs fed on a high-fat diet, as well as its potential mechanisms. Guinea pigs (n = 48) were randomly divided into six groups (n = 8/group): normal diet (control); high fat diet (model); model + low-dose capsaicin (2.5 mg/kg); model + moderate-dose capsaicin (5 mg/kg); model + high-dose capsaicin (10 mg/kg), and model + simvastatin (1.5 mg/kg) (positive control). After 14 weeks, serum lipids, apolipoprotein B100, malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), nitric oxide (NO), and endothelin-1 were measured. Aortic atherosclerotic lesions were histologically examined. eNOS and iNOS were assessed by immunohistochemistry. The model group developed severe dyslipidemia and associated histologic changes and endothelial dysfunction. All doses of capsaicin decreased total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B-100, and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (all P &lt; 0.05). Capsaicin alleviated the plaque area (-17.9-70.5%), plaque area to intima ratio (-18.0-73.6%), and intima thickness (-20.5-83.6%) (all P &lt; 0.05). Capsaicin decreased MDA (-45.5-76.1%), ET-1 (-19.6-51.6%), and average gray value (AGV) of eNOS (-10.9-48.8%), and increased SOD activity (+31.7-76.1%), NO (+11.2-36.8%), and AGV of iNOS (+6.8-+93.0%) (all P &lt; 0.05). Similar changes were observed with simvastatin. Capsaicin is beneficial to hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis in guinea pigs fed on a high-fat diet. Reduced oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction were involved in these benefits. This could represent a novel approach to prevent cardiovascular diseases.

30365937|t|Preventive effect of bergenin against the development of TNBS-induced acute colitis in rats is associated with inflammatory mediators inhibition and NLRP3/ASC inflammasome signaling pathways.
30365937|a|Ulcerative colitis is an idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by intestinal inflammation; blocking this inflammatory process may be the key to the development of new naturally occurring anti-inflammatory drugs, with greater efficiency and lower side effects. The objective of this study is to explore the effects of bergenin (BG) in TNBS (2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid)-induced acute colitis model in rats in order to assist in the studies for the development of novel natural product therapies for inflammatory bowel disease. 48 Wistar rats were randomized into six groups: (i) Control and (ii) TNBS control; (iii) 5-ASA 100 mg/kg/day (iv) BG 12 mg/kg/day (v) BG 25 mg/kg/day and (vi) BG 50 mg/kg/day. Colitis was induced by instillation of TNBS. Colitis was evaluated by an independent observer who was blinded to the treatment. Our results revealed that bergenin decreased the macroscopic and microscopic damage signs of colitis, and reduced the degree of neutrophilic infiltration in the colon tissue; also, it was capable to down-regulate COX-2, iNOS, IkB-alpha, and pSTAT3 protein expression. Similarly, using a protocol for indirect ELISA quantification of cytokines, bergenin treatment reduced IL-1beta, IFN-gamma and IL-10 levels, and inhibited both canonical (IL-1) and non-canonical (IL-11) NLRP3/ASC inflammasome signaling pathways in TNBS-induced acute colitis. Conclusion: Our study has provided evidence that administration of bergenin reduced the damage caused by TNBS in an experimental model of acute colitis in rats, reduced levels of pro-inflammatory proteins and cytokines probably by modulation of pSTAT3 and NF-kappaB signaling and blocking canonical and non-canonical NLRP3/ASC inflammasome pathways.

30368985|t|Neuroprotective effect of quercetin against radiation-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress in neurons.
30368985|a|The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays an important role in the regulation and maintenance of cellular homeostasis. However, unresolved ER stress leads to deleterious effects by inducing the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the cell. Here we have demonstrated the protective aspects of quercetin against radiation-induced ER stress and against inflammation in primary cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. The mature DRG neurons were pretreated with different concentrations of quercetin (5-100 muM) for 24 hours before 2 Gy gamma radiation exposure and then subjected to a cytotoxicity assay, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. The results showed that quercetin decreased the expression of BiP and C/EBP-homologous protein, the ER stress marker genes along with downregulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, JNK in irradiated DRG neurons. Furthermore, quercetin pretreatment significantly increased the cytoskeletal protein Tuj1 and the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the neuron. These results indicate that quercetin plays a neuroprotective role against radiation-mediated ER stress and inflammatory responses.

30368987|t|Hesperidin promotes lysosomal biogenesis in chronically ethanol-induced cardiotoxicity in rats: A proposed mechanisms of protection.
30368987|a|Alcohol consumption is a major global risk factor for mortality and morbidity. We aimed to delineate the mechanisms underlying the potential ameliorative effects of hesperidin against chronically ethanol-induced cardiotoxicity. Sixty male albino rats were divided into normal control group, hesperidin-treated control group, untreated alcoholic group, and hesperidin-treated alcoholic group. Transcription factor-EB (TFEB) expression levels were estimated using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1-alpha), macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha, poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase-1 (PARP-1) activity, and tenascin C levels in cardiac tissues were estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; while tissue malondialdehyde and total antioxidant capacity were evaluated spectrophotometrically. Our data portrayed promoting lysosomal biogenesis, as judged by upregulation of TFEB expression and its target PGC1-alpha, as well as decreased PARP-1 activity and offsetting inflammation, oxidative stress, and tissue injury as the principal culprits mediating the cardioprotective effect of hesperidin in alcohol-induced cardiotoxicity. In conclusion, hesperidin can be used as a cardioprotective agent in chronically ethanol-induced cardiotoxicity.

30381256|t|Aristolochic acid inhibits Slit2-induced migration and tube formation via inactivation of Robo1/Robo2-NCK1/NCK2 signaling pathway in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.
30381256|a|Robo1/Robo2-NCK1/NCK2 signaling pathway controls endothelial cell sprouting and migration induced by Slit2 or VEGF, but whether it is involved in peritubular capillary (PTC) rarefaction of Aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN) is unclear. In the present study, we evaluated whether AA exerts antiangiogenic effects by targeting this signaling pathways in HUVECs. HUVECs or lentivirus-mediated NCK1-overexpressing HUVECs were stimulated with AA (1, 2 or 3 mug/ml) in the absence or presence of 6 nM Slit2. Our results showed that AAI (1-3 mug/ml) dose-dependently inhibited the migration and tube formation of HUVECs. This inhibition was in parallel with down-regulated mRNA and protein expression of Slit2/Robo1/Robo2-NCK1/NCK2 signaling pathway. Importantly, overexpression of NCK1 rescued AAI-impaired angiogenesis, as evidenced by the increase of cell migration and tube formation of HUVECs in response to Slit2. The down-regulation of NCK2 and decreased activation of Rac1 was also restored by overexpression of NCK1. Taken together, our findings show that AA inhibits Slit2-induced migration and tube formation via inactivation of Robo1/Robo2-NCK1/NCK2 signaling pathway in HUVECs, and NCK1 might be a potential agent for vascular remodeling in AAN and diseases associated with impaired angiogenesis.

30391304|t|Inhibition of MARCO ameliorates silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis by regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition.
30391304|a|Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is linked to fibrosis following exposure to silica. The scavenger receptor, macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO) plays an important role in silica-induced inflammation, however, the effect of MARCO on silica-induced fibrosis has not been identified. We hypothesized that MARCO would regulate EMT and be involved in the development of silicosis. Herein, we found that MARCO was highly expressed in lung tissue after exposure to silica and a MARCO inhibitor PolyG could alleviate pulmonary fibrosis in vivo. Our results confirmed that the expression of epithelial marker such as E-cadherin decreased, while the expression of mesenchymal markers, including vimentin and alpha-SMA increased after silica treatment. Furthermore, PolyG administration efficiently blocked the mRNA and protein expression of EMT markers and decreased the level of fibrosis-related transcription factors and proteins, such as Col1a1, Col3a1, Collagen I and Collagen III in the lungs of silica-exposed rats. The findings demonstrate that the macrophage membrane receptor MARCO controls the fibrotic response through regulating EMT in experimental silicosis and suggest a novel target for preventive intervention.

30391378|t|5-Oxo-hexahydroquinoline derivatives as modulators of P-gp, MRP1 and BCRP transporters to overcome multidrug resistance in cancer cells.
30391378|a|Multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells is often associated with overexpression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, including P-glycoprotein (P-gp/ABCB1), multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1/ABCC1) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2). Modulators of these transporters might be helpful in overcoming MDR. Moreover, exploiting collateral sensitivity (CS) could be another approach for efficient treatment of cancer. Twelve novel 5-oxo-hexahydroquinoline derivatives bearing different aromatic substitutions at C4, while having 2-pyridyl alkyl carboxylate substituents at the C3 were synthesized and evaluated for MDR reversal activity by flow cytometric determination of rhodamine 123, calcein and mitoxantrone accumulations in P-gp, MRP1 and BCRP-overexpressing cell lines, respectively. Furthermore, to confirm the P-gp inhibitory activity, the effect of compounds on the reduction of doxorubicin's IC50 of drug-resistant human uterine sarcoma cell line, MES-SA/DX5, was evaluated. Compounds D6, D5 and D3 (bearing 3-chlorophenyl, 2,3-dichlorophenyl and 4-chlorophenyl substituents at C4 position of 5-oxo-hexahydroquinoline core) were the most potent P-gp, MRP1 and BCRP inhibitors, respectively, causing significant MDR reversal at concentrations of 1-10 muM. Additionally, D4 (containing 3-flourophenyl) was the most effective MRP1-dependent CS inducing agent. Overall, chlorine containing compounds D6, C4 and D3 were capable of significant inhibition of all 3 important efflux pumps in cancer cells. Moreover, D6 also induced CS triggered by reducing glutathione efflux. In conclusion, some of the 5-oxo-hexahydroquinoline derivatives are effective efflux pump inhibitors capable of simultaneously blocking 3 important ABC transporters involved in MDR, and represent promising agents to overcome MDR in cancer cells.

30393114|t|Identification of nafamostat mesilate as an inhibitor of the fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) demethylase activity.
30393114|a|Nafamostat mesilate is a serine protease inhibitor and used for the treatment of pancreatitis and cancers. The fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) was identified to be a demethylase and played an important role in physiological processes. The aim of this study was to examine the inhibition of Nafamostat mesilate on FTO demethylase activity. A combination of thermodynamic and enzymatic activity studies provides an insight into the recognition of Nafamostat mesilate by FTO. The binding of Nafamostat mesilate to FTO was driven by higher positive entropy changes and smaller negative enthalpy changes. The structural and thermodynamic information provides the basis for the design of more effective inhibitors for FTO. Our results might provide a novel target protein for Nafamostat mesilate.

30395363|t|FAM92A Underlies Nonsyndromic Postaxial Polydactyly in Humans and an Abnormal Limb and Digit Skeletal Phenotype in Mice.
30395363|a|Polydactyly is a common congenital anomaly of the hand and foot. Postaxial polydactyly (PAP) is characterized by one or more posterior or postaxial digits. In a Pakistani family with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic postaxial polydactyly type A (PAPA), we performed genomewide genotyping, linkage analysis, and exome and Sanger sequencing. Exome sequencing revealed a homozygous nonsense variant (c.478C&gt;T, p.[Arg160*]) in the FAM92A gene within the mapped region on 8q21.13-q24.12 that segregated with the PAPA phenotype. We found that FAM92A is expressed in the developing mouse limb and E11.5 limb bud including the progress zone and the apical ectodermal ridge, where it strongly localizes at the cilia level, suggesting an important role in limb patterning. The identified variant leads to a loss of the FAM92A/Chibby1 complex that is crucial for ciliogenesis and impairs the recruitment and the colocalization of FAM92A with Chibby1 at the base of the cilia. In addition, we show that Fam92a-/- homozygous mice also exhibit an abnormal digit morphology, including metatarsal osteomas and polysyndactyly, in addition to distinct abnormalities on the deltoid tuberosity of their humeri. In conclusion, we present a new nonsyndromic PAPA ciliopathy due to a loss-of-function variant in FAM92A.   2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

30399449|t|CD133 as a regulator of cancer metastasis through the cancer stem cells.
30399449|a|Cancer stem cells are the cancer cells that have abilities to self-renew, differentiate into defined progenies, and initiate and maintain tumor growth. They also contribute to cancer metastasis and therapeutic resistance, both of which are the major causes of cancer mortality. Among the reported makers of the cancer stem cells, CD133 is the most well-known marker for isolating and studying cancer stem cells in different types of cancer. The CD133high population of cancer cells are not only capable of self-renewal, proliferation, but also highly metastatic and resistant to therapy. Despite very limited information on physiological functions of CD133, many ongoing studies are aimed to reveal the mechanisms that CD133 utilizes to modulate cancer dissemination and drug resistance with a long-term goal for bringing down the number of cancer deaths. In this review, in addition to the regulation of CD133, and its involvement in cancer initiation, and development, the recent updates on how CD133 modulates cancer dissemination, and therapeutic resistance are provided. The key signaling pathways that are upstream or downstream of CD133 during these processes are summarized. A comprehensive understanding of CD133-mediated cancer initiation, development, and dissemination through its pivotal role in cancer stem cells will offer new strategies in cancer therapy.

30408459|t|The possible ameliorative effect of simvastatin versus sulfasalazine on acetic acid induced ulcerative colitis in adult rats.
30408459|a|OBJECTIVE: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic and recurrent disorders of the gastrointestinal tract with unknown etiology and have two major forms, ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn diseases. In view of the adverse effects and incomplete efficacy of currently administered drugs, it is essential to investigate new and harmless drugs with more desirable beneficial effects. Statins have many additional pleiotropic effects other than their lipid-lowering effect. This study aims to investigate the role of simvastatin (SIM) at different doses against induced UC in rats. METHODS: SIM (10, 20 mg/kg), and sulfasalazine as a standard therapy (100 mg/kg) were given from five days before and seven days after induction of UC by acetic acid (AA). Colonic mucosal inflammation was evaluated macroscopically and microscopically. Furthermore, the colonic tissue tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1beta (IL 1B), nod-like receptor family pyrin domain-1 containing 3 (NLRP3), malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH) and super oxide dismutase (SOD) were assayed in addition to immunohistochemistry of caspase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2). RESULTS: SIM in a dose dependant manner significantly improved macroscopic and histological scores, diminished colonic levels of IL 1B, TNF-alpha, NLRP3, MDA, caspase-1 and COX2 and elevated GSH and SOD. CONCLUSION: SIM has anti-inflammatory, cytoprotective and antioxidants effects that are not directly related to its cholesterol lowering activity against AA induced colitis this makes it a new therapeutic target for UC.

30408497|t|Histamine-4 receptor antagonist JNJ7777120 inhibits pro-inflammatory microglia and prevents the progression of Parkinson-like pathology and behaviour in a rat model.
30408497|a|The activation of microglial cells is presumed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The activity of microglia is regulated by the histamine-4 receptor (H4R), thus providing a novel target that may prevent the progression of PD. However, this putative mechanism has so far not been validated. In our previous study, we found that mRNA expression of H4R was upregulated in PD patients. In the present study, we validated this possible mechanism using the rotenone-induced PD rat model, in which mRNA expression levels of H4R-, and microglial markers were significantly increased in the ventral midbrain. Inhibition of H4R in rotenone-induced PD rat model by infusion of the specific H4R antagonist JNJ7777120 into the lateral ventricle resulted in blockade of microglial activation. In addition, pharmacological targeting of H4R in rotenone-lesioned rats resulted in reduced apomorphine-induced rotational behaviour, prevention of dopaminergic neuron degeneration and associated decreases in striatal dopamine levels. These changes were accompanied by a reduction of Lewy body-like neuropathology. Our results provide first proof of the efficacy of an H4R antagonist in a commonly used PD rat model, and proposes the H4R as a promising target to clinically tackle microglial activation and thereby the progression of PD.

30414920|t|Hyphae fragments from A. fumigatus sensitize lung cells to silica particles (Min-U-Sil): Increased release of IL-1beta.
30414920|a|Exposure to particulate matter (PM), such as mineral particles and biological particles/components may be linked to aggravation of respiratory diseases, including asthma. Here we report that exposure to Aspergillus fumigatus hyphae fragments (AFH) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced both mRNA synthesis and release of pro-inflammatory interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) in both human THP-1 monocytes (THP-1 Mo) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-differentiated THP-1 monocytes (THP-1 macrophages; THP-1 Ma); while Min-U-Sil alone enhanced the release of IL-1beta only in THP-1 Ma. Co-exposure to LPS or AFH with Min-U-Sil caused a synergistic release of IL-1beta when compared to single exposures. In contrast, Min-U-Sil did not markedly change LPS- and AFH-induced release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). The combined exposures did not increase the LPS- and AFH-induced expression of IL-1beta mRNA. Notably, the AFH- and LPS-induced IL-1beta responses with and without co-exposure to Min-U-Sil in THP-1 Mo were found to be caspase-dependent as shown by inhibition with zYVAD-fmk. Furthermore, co-exposure with AFH and Min-U-Sil resulted in similar synergistic releases of IL-1beta in primary human airway macrophages (AM; sputum), peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) and in the human bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B). In conclusion, AFH induce both the synthesis and release of IL-1beta. However, Min-U-Sil further enhanced the cleavage of the induced pro-IL-1beta.

30420649|t|Subtype-specific regulatory network rewiring in acute myeloid leukemia.
30420649|a|Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease caused by a variety of alterations in transcription factors, epigenetic regulators and signaling molecules. To determine how different mutant regulators establish AML subtype-specific transcriptional networks, we performed a comprehensive global analysis of cis-regulatory element activity and interaction, transcription factor occupancy and gene expression patterns in purified leukemic blast cells. Here, we focused on specific subgroups of subjects carrying mutations in genes encoding transcription factors (RUNX1, CEBPalpha), signaling molecules (FTL3-ITD, RAS) and the nuclear protein NPM1). Integrated analysis of these data demonstrates that each mutant regulator establishes a specific transcriptional and signaling network unrelated to that seen in normal cells, sustaining the expression of unique sets of genes required for AML growth and maintenance.

30423314|t|Lactic acid induced microRNA-744 enhances motility of SiHa cervical cancer cells through targeting ARHGAP5.
30423314|a|High-risk (hr) human papillomaviruses (HPV) infection and integration has caused the majority of cervical cancer, of which E6 and E7 oncogenes are invariably retained and expressed to immortalize cells probably via affecting cell migration and invasion, and tumor metastasis. However, the underlying mechanism that mediates the procedure such as motility of cervical cancer cells within the tumor microenvironment is not well understood. Herein, we examined one possible factor-extracellular lactic acid, an end up chemical in glycolytic tumor cells, on the motility in HPV16 positive SiHa cells. The results showed that lactic acid enhanced cell migration and invasion behavior via stimulating the expression of miR-744. ARHGAP5 was confirmed to be a target of miR-744, and silencing ARHGAP5 exhibited an inhibiting effect on cell migration and invasion as that observed by suppressing miR-744. In addition, lactic acid down-regulated E6 and E7 protein levels, and overexpression of either miR-744 or ARHGAP5 could also reduce E6 and E7 levels. Overall, our findings suggest that the miR-774/ARHGAP5 axis may provide a vital role in triggering lactic acid-induced migration and invasion in SiHa cells, regardless of the diminished effect due to the partial inhibition of E6 and E7 expression.

Our results showed that OHC and THC dose-dependently enhanced liver function (ALT and AST levels) and alleviated histopathological deterioration. Besides, OHC and THC significantly restored the hepatic antioxidant status by miring level of MDA and ROS, and elevated levels of GSH, SOD, CAT and T-AOC. In addition, OHC and THC markedly suppressed the activity and expressions of CYP2E1, and bound to the active sites of CYP2E1. Moreover, OHC and THC activated the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway and enormously enhanced the translational activation of Nrf2-targeted gene (GCLC, GCLM, NQO1 and HO-1) against oxidative stress, via inhibiting the expression of Keap1 and blocking the interaction between Keap1 and Nrf2. Particularly, OHC and THC exerted superior hepato-protective and antioxidant activities to CUR. In conclusion, OHC and THC possess favorable hepato-protective effect through restoring antioxidant status, inhibiting CYP2E1 and activating Keap1-Nrf2 pathway, which might represent promising antioxidants for the treatment of APAP-induced hepatotoxicity.

30447388|t|Methylglyoxal disturbs the expression of antioxidant, apoptotic and glycation responsive genes and triggers programmed cell death in human leukocytes.
30447388|a|Methylglyoxal (MG) is a alpha-dycarbonyl compound derived mainly from glycolysis, whose accumulation is harmful for cells and tissues. Here, we evaluated the cytotoxic effects induced by MG in leukocytes after an acute exposure, measuring as endpoints of toxicity some markers of oxidative stress and programmed cell death. Human leukocytes were isolated and incubated with MG at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 mM for 2.5 h, and subsequently prepared for assays based in flow cytometry, gene expression and immunoreactivity profile. The cells exposed to higher concentrations of MG had significant loss of viability, increased reactive species (RS) production and apoptosis/necrosis rate. These phenomena were accompanied by morphological changes (increased size and granularity) and disruption in mRNA expression of antioxidant, apoptotic and glycation-responsive genes, particularly: Nrf2 (Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2), SOD1 (CuZn-superoxide dismutase), SOD2 (Mn-superoxide dismutase), GSR (glutathione-S-reductase), BAX (BAX-associated X protein), BCL-2 (BCL-2-associated X protein), AIF (apoptosis inducing factor), GLO-1 (glyoxalase-1) and RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products). The mRNA expression of CASP 9 and CASP 3 (caspase-9 and 3) as well as the immunoreactivity of proteins were not changed by MG. Collectively, our data provide evidence that MG activates programmed cell death pathways in leukocytes and that this effect seems to be associated with disturbances in cell redox signaling.

30447611|t|Neurobehavioral effects of bisphenol S exposure in early life stages of zebrafish larvae (Danio rerio).
30447611|a|As an alternate of bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol S (BPS) is now widely used to produce our daily consumer goods. Some studies have shown that BPS has the potential to disrupt the reproduction and glucose homeostasis. However, the impact of BPS on the nervous system remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of BPS on the nervous systems of zebrafish in their early growing stages. The 96 h-LC50 value of BPS to zebrafish larvae was 323 mg/L (95%CI: 308-339 mg/L). Zebrafish embryos were exposed to BPS at concentrations of 0, 0.03, 0.3 and 3.0 mg/L until 6 days postfertilization. Our results showed that 0.3 and 3.0 mg/L BPS exposure markedly decreased locomotor behavior, accompany by the increased oxidative stress, promoted apoptosis and altered retinal structure in zebrafish. In addition, the expression levels of six neurodevelopment genes (alpha1-tubulin, elavl3, gap43, mbp, syn2a and gfap) were downregulated after 3.0 mg/L BPS treatment. In conclusion, BPS may affect locomotor behavior and alter retinal structure in zebrafish larvae partially by increasing oxidative stress, and by suppressing the expression levels of neurodevelopment genes.

30448556|t|Overexpression of HIF-1a could partially protect K562 cells from 1,4-benzoquinone induced toxicity by inhibiting ROS, apoptosis and enhancing glycolysis.
30448556|a|Benzene is an environmental contaminant which causes hematological diseases. Previously, hypoxia inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) was found to be involved in benzene-induced hematotoxicity. This study aims to explore whether overexpression of HIF-1a in K562 cell line could influence the toxicity caused by 1,4-BQ. HIF-1a overexpression K562 cell line was constructed with a lentiviral vector. Results showed that HIF-1a was significantly elevated in control K562 cells and HIF-1a overexpression cells exposed to 1,4-BQ. Compared with 1,4-BQ exposed control cells, HIF-1a overexpression blocked cell cycle at G2/M phase, remarkably reduced apoptosis and ROS level. And HIF-1a overexpression caused downregulation of Nox4 and upregulation of Bcl-2. In addition, the lactic acid (LD)/pyruvic acid (PA) ratio was significantly higher in HIF-1a overexpression cells than that in control cells at the same 1,4-BQ dose. Furthermore, significant increases in Glut1, Ldha, Pkm2, Pgk1, Pdk1, Pfkl, Pfkfb3 protein levels was also observed in HIF-1a overexpression cells. Overall, our results indicated that HIF-1a overexpression could alleviate ROS and apoptosis caused by 1,4-BQ through targeting Nox4, Bcl-2 and key enzymes in glycolysis.

30452514|t|Association of Prenatal Exposure to Air Pollution With Autism Spectrum Disorder.
30452514|a|Importance: The etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is poorly understood, but prior studies suggest associations with airborne pollutants. Objective: To evaluate the association between prenatal exposures to airborne pollutants and ASD in a large population-based cohort. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cohort encompassed nearly all births in Metro Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, from 2004 through 2009, with follow-up through 2014. Children were diagnosed with ASD using a standardized assessment with the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. Monthly mean exposures to particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 microm (PM2.5), nitric oxide (NO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) at the maternal residence during pregnancy were estimated with temporally adjusted, high-resolution land use regression models. The association between prenatal air pollution exposures and the odds of developing ASD was evaluated using logistic regression adjusted for child sex, birth month, birth year, maternal age, maternal birthplace, and neighborhood-level urbanicity and income band. Data analysis occurred from June 2016 to May 2018. Exposures: Mean monthly concentrations of ambient PM2.5, NO, and NO2 at the maternal residence during pregnancy, calculated retrospectively using temporally adjusted, high-resolution land use regression models. Main Outcomes and Measures: Autism spectrum disorder diagnoses based on standardized assessment of the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. The hypothesis being tested was formulated during data collection. Results: In a cohort of 132 256 births, 1307 children (1.0%) were diagnosed with ASD by the age of 5 years. The final sample size for the PM2.5-adjusted model was 129 439 children, and for NO and NO2, it was 129 436 children; of these, 1276 (1.0%) were diagnosed with ASD. Adjusted odds ratios for ASD per interquartile range (IQR) were not significant for exposure to PM2.5 during pregnancy (1.04 [95% CI, 0.98-1.10] per 1.5 mug/m3 increase [IQR] in PM2.5) or NO2 (1.06 [95% CI, 0.99-1.12] per 4.8 ppb [IQR] increase in NO2) but the odds ratio was significant for NO (1.07 [95% CI, 1.01-1.13] per 10.7 ppb [IQR] increase in NO). Odds ratios for male children were 1.04 (95% CI, 0.98-1.10) for PM2.5; 1.09 (95% CI, 1.02-1.15) for NO; and 1.07 (95% CI, 1.00-1.13) for NO2. For female children, they were for 1.03 (95% CI, 0.90-1.18) for PM2.5; 0.98 (95% CI, 0.83-1.13) for NO; and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.86-1.16) for NO2. Conclusions and Relevance: In a population-based birth cohort, we detected an association between exposure to NO and ASD but no significant association with PM2.5 and NO2.

30452899|t|Oenothein B inhibits human non-small cell lung cancer A549 cell proliferation by ROS-mediated PI3K/Akt/NF-kappaB signaling pathway.
30452899|a|Oenothein B has a wide range of biological activities. The present study probed into the underlying mechanism on how Oenothein B inhibits the proliferation of a lung cancer line A549. Our results showed that Oenothein B effectively inhibited the proliferation of A549 cells by inducing apoptosis and arresting cells at G1 stage. Furthermore, Oenothein B not only increased the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), but also induced the upregulation of intracellular apoptotic triggers (cleavage caspase-3, PARP, cytochrome c level in the cytosol, Bax). Moreover, ROS inhibitor (N-acetyl-L-cystein, NAC) and PI3K agonist (Insulin-like growth factor 1, IGF-1) could resist cell proliferation inhibition induced by Oenothein B, respectively. ROS inhibitor significantly abrogated the activation of caspase 3/7 and 9 in the presence of Oenothein B. Additionally, suppression of p-PI3K and p-Akt, p-NF-kappaB by Oenothein B could be compensated by treatment with ROS inhibitor. To summarize, these results demonstrated that Oenothein B was able to prevent cell proliferation probably via ROS-mediated PI3K/Akt/NF-kappaB signaling pathway.

30468867|t|Decabromodiphenyl ether exacerbates hyperglycemia in diet-induced obese mice.
30468867|a|Decabromodiphenyl ether (decaBDE) is a brominated flame retardant used in plastic and textile articles. It has become a ubiquitous environmental contaminant, however; the relationship between decaBDE and obesity remains to be elucidated. We aimed to clarify if oral decaBDE exposure can be a factor in obesity and its related metabolic dysfuctions. Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed a normal (ND, 9.0 kcal% fat) or high-fat (HFD, 62.2 kcal% fat) diet and treated with decaBDE (the equivalent of three doses of 0, 0.5 (L-DecaBDE), and 10 (H-DecaBDE) mug/kg body weight/day) ad libitum in drinking water from 5 to 20 weeks of age. In HFD-fed mice, decaBDE exposure markedly increased both fasting blood glucose levels compared with vehicle exposure, which was more prominent in H-DecaBDE-exposed mice. DecaBDE exposure significantly reduced mRNA levels of glucose transporter 4 and thyroid hormone receptor alpha in skeletal muscle and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 in brown adipose tissue compared with vehicle exposure under HFD-feeding. The tendency for hyperglycemia and the remarkable activation of insulin signaling pathway-related genes were observed in ND + DecaBDE mice compared to the ND + Vehicle mice. These results demonstrate that decaBDE can contribute to the enhancement of diet-induced hyperglycemia through disruption of glucose homeostasis.

30469162|t|Ephrin-B1, -B2, and -B4 Expression is Decreased in Developing Diaphragms and Lungs of Fetal Rats with Nitrofen-Induced Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia.
30469162|a|INTRODUCTION:  Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is assumed to originate from a malformation of the amuscular mesenchymal component of the primordial diaphragm. Mutations in ephrin-B1, a membrane protein that is expressed by mesenchymal cells, have been found in newborn infants with CDH and associated pulmonary hypoplasia (PH), highlighting its important role during diaphragmatic and airway development. Ephrin-B1, -B2, and -B4 are expressed in fetal rat lungs and have been identified as key players during lung branching morphogenesis. We hypothesized that diaphragmatic and pulmonary expression of ephrin-B1, -B2, and -B4 is decreased in the nitrofen-induced CDH model. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Time-mated rats received nitrofen or vehicle on day 9 (D9). Fetal diaphragms (n = 72) and lungs (n = 72) were harvested on D13, D15, and D18, and divided into control and nitrofen-exposed specimens. Ephrin-B1, -B2, and -B4 gene expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Immunofluorescence double staining for ephrin-B1, -B2, and -B4 was combined with mesenchymal and epithelial markers (Gata-4/Fgf-10 and calcitonin gene-related peptide) to evaluate protein expression/localization. RESULTS:  Ephrin-B1, -B2, and -B4 gene expression was significantly reduced in pleuroperitoneal folds/primordial lungs (D13), developing diaphragms/lungs (D15), and fully muscularized diaphragms/differentiated lungs (D18) of nitrofen-exposed fetuses compared with controls. Confocal laser scanning microscopy demonstrated markedly diminished ephrin-B1 immunofluorescence in diaphragmatic and pulmonary mesenchyme of nitrofen-exposed fetuses on D13, D15, and D18 compared with controls, whereas ephrin-B2 and -B4 expression was mainly decreased in distal airway epithelium. CONCLUSION:  Decreased ephrin-B1, -B2, and -B4 expression may disrupt diaphragmatic development and lung branching morphogenesis by interfering with epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, thus causing diaphragmatic defects and PH.

30476289|t|Familial Mediterranean fever: breaking all the (genetic) rules.
30476289|a|OBJECTIVE: FMF is an inherited autoinflammatory syndrome, characterized by attacks of painful periodic fever caused by diffuse serositis and risk of secondary amyloidosis due to IL-1beta-mediated inflammation. The disease appears to be transmitted through autosomal recessive mutations in the MEFV gene encoding the pyrin protein Although more than 300 variants have been reported worldwide so far, their association with symptom severity, the relative frequencies in different populations and the disease penetrance are far from being completely understood. We investigated genotype-phenotype correlations in two large nuclear families and verified whether commonly used web-based tools can usefully predict variant pathogenicity in FMF. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 15 patients of two families who had been diagnosed with FMF according to international criteria. The entire MEFV coding region was sequenced in all subjects, and 179 MEFV variants were surveyed with five different pathogenicity predictors. RESULTS: The inheritance of FMF could not be explained by traditional autosomal recessivity in both families. In silico tools demonstrated a significant association of variants' pathogenicity with their position along the coding sequence but not with variants' frequency. CONCLUSION: By describing two large families with paradigmatic complexity of FMF genetics, we conclude that established concepts in assessing the causative role of variants identified in mutation screening cannot be easily translated into appropriate genetic counselling in FMF. Furthermore, we demonstrate that variants frequently associated with severe disease are not predicted to significantly impact protein function using in silico algorithms.

30478443|t|Gain-of-function DNMT3A mutations cause microcephalic dwarfism and hypermethylation of Polycomb-regulated regions.
30478443|a|DNA methylation and Polycomb are key factors in the establishment of vertebrate cellular identity and fate. Here we report de novo missense mutations in DNMT3A, which encodes the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A. These mutations cause microcephalic dwarfism, a hypocellular disorder of extreme global growth failure. Substitutions in the PWWP domain abrogate binding to the histone modifications H3K36me2 and H3K36me3, and alter DNA methylation in patient cells. Polycomb-associated DNA methylation valleys, hypomethylated domains encompassing developmental genes, become methylated with concomitant depletion of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 bivalent marks. Such de novo DNA methylation occurs during differentiation of Dnmt3aW326R pluripotent cells in vitro, and is also evident in Dnmt3aW326R/+ dwarf mice. We therefore propose that the interaction of the DNMT3A PWWP domain with H3K36me2 and H3K36me3 normally limits DNA methylation of Polycomb-marked regions. Our findings implicate the interplay between DNA methylation and Polycomb at key developmental regulators as a determinant of organism size in mammals.

30500380|t|Metabolic activity testing can underestimate acute drug cytotoxicity as revealed by HepG2 cell clones overexpressing cytochrome P450 2C19 and 3A4.
30500380|a|Preclinical drug safety assessment includes in vitro studies with physiologically relevant cell cultures. As an in vitro system for hepatic toxicology testing, we have been generating cell clones of human hepatoblastoma cell line HepG2 by lentiviral transduction of phase I cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Here, we present a stable CYP2C19-overexpressing HepG2 cell clone (HepG2-2C19 C1) showing an enzyme activity of approximately 82 pmol x min-1 x mg-1 total cellular protein. The phenotypic stability over several passages of HepG2-2C19 C1 renders them to be a suitable reference cell clone for benchmarking CYP2C19 enzyme activity. In addition, we were interested to analyze acute cytotoxicity of the model drug cyclophosphamide (CPA) metabolized by HepG2-2C19 C1 and by a previously generated CYP3A4-overexpressing HepG2 cell clone. Upon 10 mM CPA exposure, we were able to detect its metabolites 4-hydroxy-cyclophosphamide and acrolein in CYP3A4- and CYP2C19-expressing cell clones, but not in parental HepG2 cell line. XTT and ATP assays showed a modest reduction of cell viability of not more than 50% with high dose (10 mM) CPA treatment. By contrast, dramatic acute cytotoxic effects of CPA were evident by the formation of nuclear gammaH2AX foci and by increased cell death events. These effects were paralleled by substantial decreases of cell membrane integrity as measured by the trypan blue exclusion test. Our data on CYP enzyme overexpressing HepG2 cell clones clearly show that cytotoxicity of CPA is dramatically underestimated by standard metabolic activity tests. Thus, additional tests to quantitate DNA damage formation and cell death induction might be required to realistically assess cytotoxicity of such compounds.

30500551|t|Melatonin protects against sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction by regulating apoptosis and autophagy via activation of SIRT1 in mice.
30500551|a|AIMS: The apoptosis and autophagy play an important role in the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction. Previous studies have demonstrated that melatonin protects against cardiac dysfunction during sepsis. In addition, silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) is a therapeutic target for sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction. The aims of this study were to investigate whether SIRT1 was involved in melatonin's cardioprotection during sepsis and the mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, twenty-four male C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to four groups: Control group, LPS group, LPS + Melatonin group and LPS + Melatonin + EX527 group. Mice were treated with lipopolysaccharide for 8 h with or without melatonin or EX527. The cardiac function, myocardial injury biomarkers, cardiac histopathology, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, autophagosome as well as the protein expressions of SIRT1, cleaved caspase-3, LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and p62 in the myocardium were assayed. KEY FINDINGS: The results demonstrated that melatonin significantly improved cardiac function, decreased creatine kinase (CK) and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) levels, attenuated myocardial architecture destruction, inhibited cardiomyocyte apoptosis and increased cardiac autophagy as compared with the LPS group. In addition, melatonin significantly increased SIRT1 protein expression in the myocardium of mice with sepsis, while inhibition of SIRT1 by EX527 abolished melatonin's cardioprotection during sepsis. SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, we found that melatonin protected against sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction by regulating apoptosis and autophagy via activation of SIRT1 in mice.

30503586|t|Alternariol induced proliferation in primary mouse keratinocytes and inflammation in mouse skin is regulated via PGE2/EP2/cAMP/p-CREB signaling pathway.
30503586|a|Alternariol (AOH) is a mycotoxin that contaminates various food stuffs as well as animal feed and may cause toxicity after consumption. However, a dermal toxic potential of AOH has not been explored so far. In the present study, skin toxicity after topical exposure of AOH and the involved mechanism/s are revealed. Single topical application of different AOH doses (12.5, 25, 50 mug/animal) caused increased bi-fold thickness as well as hyperplasia and higher production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) along with cAMP in the skin demonstrating its inflammatory potential. Western blot analysis showed that exposure of AOH lead to phosphorylation of CREB and increased the expression of COX-2, cyclin D1 as well as prostanoid EP2 receptor. Further studies on primary mouse keratinocytes (PMK) revealed that very low concentrations of AOH (50-500 nM) resulted in significant PMK proliferation. Additionally, using specific antagonist or agonist of prostanoid receptors, we delineated that EP2 receptor play a key role in AOH-induced PMKs proliferation. Collectively, our findings show that AOH can lead to dermal toxicity in mice by activating the EP2/cAMP/p-CREB signaling cascade.

30506648|t|Tanshinone I attenuates proliferation and chemoresistance of cervical cancer in a KRAS-dependent manner.
30506648|a|Chemoresistance is a common occurrence during advanced or recurrent cervical cancer therapy when treated by conventional treatment, platinum-based chemotherapy. This study aimed to investigate the effect and underlying mechanism of tanshinone I on attenuating proliferation and chemoresistance of cervical cancer cells. In cervical cancer cells, cell proliferation was examined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), cell count, and soft-agar colony-formation assay. rVista analysis and luciferase reporter assay were used to explore the upstream regulator of KRAS, and the expression levels of key genes were also detected. Western blot analysis showed that tanshinone I significantly suppressed KRAS expression and inhibited AKT phosphorylation. rVista analysis and luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that ELK1 can binds directly to KRAS promoter and positively regulates KRAS expression. MTT assay showed that KRAS or ELK1 overexpression significantly attenuated the suppressive effects of tanshinone I on HeLa cells proliferation. In addition, tanshinone I recovered the cisplatin sensitivity of HeLa CR cells, whereas KRAS or ELK1 overexpression significantly inhibited this phenomenon. Our results suggested that tanshinone I had anticancer effects on cervical cancer cells via inhibiting ELK1 and downregulating KRAS-AKT axis, which subsequently suppressed the proliferation and cisplatin resistance of cervical cancer cells.

30506710|t|Geraniol and lupeol inhibit growth and promote apoptosis in human hepatocarcinoma cells through the MAPK signaling pathway.
30506710|a|OBJECTIVES: Hepatocarcinoma is one of the most lethal cancers, leading to a 5-year survival rate as low as 30% due to recurrence and metastasis. The treatment of liver cancer includes surgery and medication, of which, the former is more effective. However, surgical resection is applicable in less than 40% of patients. Therefore, it is imperative to find effective medication options for liver cancer therapy. METHODS: In this study, we found that two natural products, geraniol and lupeol, had antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects on the hepatocarcinoma cell lines SMMC7721 and HepG2. We also detected a lower expression level of Bcl-2 and upregulation of BAX and caspase in the presence of geraniol and lupeol. RESULTS: Furthermore, geraniol or lupeol also altered the phosphorylation level of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, P38, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases, suggesting involvement in mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided direct evidence to support the effect of geraniol and lupeol in hepatocarcinoma cell growth and apoptosis, which indicated the potential application of these two natural products in anti-liver cancer therapy.

30515700|t|Thrombin and the Protease-Activated Receptor-1 in Organophosphate-Induced Status Epilepticus.
30515700|a|Organophosphates (OP) are a major threat to the health of soldiers and civilians due to their use as chemical weapons in war and in terror attacks. Among the acute manifestations of OP poisoning, status epilepticus (SE) is bearing the highest potential for long-term damages. Current therapies do not prevent brain damage and seizure-related brain injuries in OP-exposed humans. Thrombin is a serine protease known to have a fundamental function in the clotting cascade. It is highly expressed in the brain where we have previously found that it regulates synaptic transmission and plasticity. In addition, we have found that an excess of thrombin in the brain leads to hyperexcitability and therefore seizures through a glutamate-dependent mechanism. In the current study, we carried out in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo experiments in order to determine the role of thrombin and its receptor PAR-1 in paraoxon-induced SE. Elevated thrombin activity was found in the brain slices from mice that were treated (in vitro and in vivo) with paraoxon. Increased levels of PAR-1 and pERK proteins and decreased prothrombin mRNA were found in the brains of paraoxon-treated mice. Furthermore, ex vivo and in vivo electrophysiological experiments showed that exposure to paraoxon causes elevated electrical activity in CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. Moreover, a specific PAR-1 antagonist (SCH79797) reduced this activity. Altogether, these results reveal the importance of thrombin and PAR-1 in paraoxon poisoning. In addition, the results indicate that thrombin and PAR-1 may be a possible target for the treatment of paraoxon-induced status epilepticus.

30517881|t|Clethodim exposure induces developmental immunotoxicity and neurobehavioral dysfunction in zebrafish embryos.
30517881|a|Clethodim is one of the most widely used herbicides in agriculture, but its potential negative effects on aquatic organisms are still poorly understood. This study examined the effects of clethodim on zebrafish at aspects of early stage embryonic development, immune toxicity, cell apoptosis and locomotor behavior. Firstly, clethodim exposure markedly decreased the survival rate, body length, and heart rate and resulted in a series of morphological abnormalities, primarily spinal deformities (SD) and yolk sac edema, in zebrafish larvae. Secondly, the number of immune cells was substantially reduced but the levels of apoptosis and oxidative stress were significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner upon clethodim exposure. Thirdly, we evaluated the expression of some key genes in TLR signaling including TLR4, MyD88, and NF-kappaB p65 and they were all up-regulated by exposure to 300 mug/L clethodim. Meanwhile, some proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL8, and IFN-gamma were also activated in both the mock and the TLR4-KD conditions. Moreover, the locomotor behaviors and the enzymatic activities of AChE were obviously inhibited but the levels of acetylated histone H3 were greatly increased by clethodim exposure. In addition, incubation of zebrafish larvae with acetylcholine receptor (AChR) agonist carbachol can partially rescue the clethodim-modulated locomotor behavior. Taken together, our results suggest that clethodim has the potential to induce developmental immunotoxicity and cause behavioral alterations in zebrafish larvae. The information presented in this study will help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying clethodim exposure in aquatic ecosystems.

30522414|t|Hollow S-nitrosothiols nanoparticle with polymeric brushes for nitric oxide (NO)-releasing as tumor targeted chemotherapy.
30522414|a|A kind of tumor targeting nitric oxide donor nanoparticle with brushes is described in this paper. The poly(4-vinylphenylboronic acid) polymeric brush, which shows glucose and pH dual responsiveness, endows the ability of hollow S-nitrosothiols nanoparticle to accurate recognition and binding with the sialic acid over-expressed type tumor cells, such as HepG2 and MCF-7 cells. In vitro experiments, including cells capture and release experiments, confocal fluorescence microscope characterization, cytotoxicity assay with different cells, demonstrate the selective recognition and the controlled NO release to kill tumor cells for these S-nitrosothiols nanoparticles. Low concentration of the released NO from the S-nitrosothiols nanoparticles in the transmission would participate physiological activity and avoid serious side effects because the endogenous nature and the physiological necessity to regulate normal biological functions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report about polymer nanoparticles as NO donors with functional brushes to selectively identify tumor cells and release NO in a controlled manner.

30529121|t|The cytotoxicity activity of Hohenbuehelia serotina polyphenols on HeLa cells via induction of cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.
30529121|a|Hohenbuehelia serotina, is not only one important source of polysaccharides but also a good origin of polyphenols with antineoplastic functions in non-clinical researches. In this study, the polyphenols from H. serotina (HSP) were mainly composed by caffeic acid dimer, (-)-epicatechin-3-(3'-o-methyl)-gallic acid dimer, quercetin-acetyl-rutinoside hexoside, (-)-epigallocatechin derivatives, rutin derivatives, catechin trimer and 3-caffeoylquinic acid. HSP significantly inhibited the proliferation of HeLa cells in vitro, and induced intracellular ROS accumulation. It was also observed that induction of HeLa cells apoptosis and termination of cell cycle at G0/G1 phase were associated with the anti-tumor activity of HSP. On the basis of the expanded investigations of anti-neoplasm mechanism, HSP could decrease the mRNA expressions of cell cycle related genes including cyclin D1, Ckd2 and Cdk4, and increase the mRNA expressions of p53 and p21. In addition, the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in HeLa cells was initiated by HSP through activation of Bax, cytochrome c and Caspase-3, as well as inhibition of Bcl-2. This study might provide a theoretical basis for the application of H. serotina polyphenols as tumor preventive agent.

30543783|t|Methyl ferulic acid attenuates liver fibrosis and hepatic stellate cell activation through the TGF-beta1/Smad and NOX4/ROS pathways.
30543783|a|Liver fibrosis is a pathological wound-healing response caused by chronic liver damage due to a virus, autoimmune disorder, or drugs. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) play an essential role in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis. Methyl ferulic acid (MFA), a biologically active monomer, has a protective effect on liver injury. However, the effects and roles of MFA in liver fibrosis remain unknown. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the effect of MFA on hepatic fibrosis and the underlying mechanisms. Human hepatic stellate LX-2 cells were exposed to 5 mug/L TGF-beta1 for 48 h to stimulate liver fibrosis in vitro. Using MTT, RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, we revealed that MFA significantly inhibited the proliferation of LX-2 cells as well as decreased the expressions of alpha-SMA and type I collagen in LX-2 cells. SD rats were fed with ethanol, and this combined with the intraperitoneal injection of CCl4 induced liver fibrosis in vivo. We found that the administration of MFA markedly decreased the levels of hyaluronic acid (HA), procollagen type III (PC-III), type IV collagen (CIV) and laminin (LN) in the serum, inhibited the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) as well as type I and type III collagen, and up-regulated the ratio of MMP-2/TIMP-1 in rats. The antifibrotic effects of MFA were also evaluated by H&amp;E staining and Masson's trichrome staining. In addition, further studies suggested that this protection by MFA from liver fibrosis was possibly related to the inhibition of TGF-beta1/Smad and NOX4/ROS signalling. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that MFA attenuated liver fibrosis and hepatic stellate cell activation by inhibiting the TGF-beta1/Smad and NOX4/ROS signalling pathways.

30565903|t|ERbeta agonist alters RNA splicing factor expression and has a longer window of antidepressant effectiveness than estradiol after long-term ovariectomy
30565903|a|Background: Estrogen therapy (ET), an effective treatment for perimenopausal depression, often fails to ameliorate symptoms when initiated late after the onset of menopause. Our previous work has suggested that alternative splicing of RNA might mediate these differential effects of ET. Methods: Female Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with estradiol (E2) or vehicle 6 days (early ET) or 180 days (late ET) after ovariectomy (OVX). We investigated the differential expression of RNA splicing factors and tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) protein using a customized RT2 Profiler PCR Array, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunoprecipitation and behaviour changes in clinically relevant early and late ET. Results: Early ET, but not late ET, prolonged swimming time in the forced swim test and reduced anxiety-like behaviours in the elevated plus maze. It reversed OVX-increased (SFRS7 and SFRS16) or OVX-decreased (ZRSR2 and CTNNB1) mRNA levels of splicing factors and ERbeta splicing changes in the brains of OVX rats. Early ET, but not late ET, also increased the expression of TPH2 and decreased monoamine oxidase A levels in the dorsal raphe in the brains of OVX rats. In late ET, only diarylpropionitrile (an ERbeta-specific agonist) achieved similar results : not E2 (an ERalpha and ERbeta agonist) or propylpyrazoletriol (an ERalpha-specific agonist). Limitations: Our experimental paradigm mimicked early and late ET in the clinical setting, but the contribution of age and OVX might be difficult to distinguish. Conclusion: These findings suggest that ERbeta alternative splicing and altered responses in the regulatory system for serotonin may mediate the antidepressant efficacy of ET associated with the timing of therapy initiation. It is likely that ERbeta-specific ligands would be effective estrogen-based antidepressants late after the onset of menopause.

30567741|t|Benzene-induced mouse hematotoxicity is regulated by a protein phosphatase 2A complex that stimulates transcription of cytochrome P4502E1.
30567741|a|Chronic benzene exposure is associated with hematotoxicity and the development of aplastic anemia and leukemia. However, the signaling pathways underlying benzene-induced hematotoxicity remain to be defined. Here, we investigated the role of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in the regulation of benzene-induced hematotoxicity in a murine model. Male mice with a hepatocyte-specific homozygous deletion of the Ppp2r1a gene (encoding PP2A Aalpha subunit) (HO) and matched wildtype (WT) mice were exposed to benzene via inhalation at doses of 1, 10, and 100 ppm for 28 days. Peripheral white blood cell counts and activation of bone marrow progenitors were attenuated in the HO mice, indicating that Ppp2r1a deletion protects against benzene-induced hematotoxicity. Moreover, elevation of urinary S-phenyl mercapturic acid, a benzene metabolite, was much greater in WT mice than in HO mice. Real-time exhalation analysis revealed more exhaled benzene but fewer benzene metabolites in HO mice than in WT mice, possibly because of the down-regulation of Cyp2e1, encoding cytochrome P4502E1, in hepatocytes of the HO mice. Loss-of-function screening disclosed that PP2A complexes containing the B56alpha subunit participate in regulating Cyp2e1 expression. Notably, PP2A-B56alpha suppression in HepG2 cells resulted in persistent beta-catenin phosphorylation at Ser33-Ser37-Thr41 in response to CYP2E1 agonists. In parallel, nuclear translocation of beta-catenin was inhibited, concomitant with a remarkable decrease of Cyp2e1 expression. These findings support the notion that a regulatory cascade comprising PP2A-B56alpha, beta-catenin, and Cyp2e1 is involved in benzene-induced hematotoxicity, providing critical insight into the role of PP2A in responses to the environmental chemicals.

30572104|t|Cigarette smoking aggravates bleomycin-induced experimental pulmonary fibrosis.
30572104|a|Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive lung disease that typically leads to respiratory failure and death. The cause of IPF is poorly understood. Although several environmental and occupational factors are considered as risk factors in IPF, cigarette smoking seems to be the most strongly associated risk factor. Here firstly, we treated mice with cigarette (16 mg tar, 1.0 mg nicotine in each cigarette) smoking and tried to explore the role of cigarette smoking in pulmonary fibrosis. Mice were continuously subjected to smoke for about 1 h each day (12 cigarettes per day, 5 days per week) during 40 days. Bleomycin was administrated by intraperitoneal injection at a dose of 40 mg/kg on days 1, 5, 8, 11 and 15. We found bleomycin induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice, and cigarette smoking augmented bleomycin-induced fibrosis reflected by both in fibrotic area and percentages of collagen in the lungs. Then we prepared and employed cigarette smoke extract (CSE) in cell models and found that CSE could induce the activation of p-Smad2/3 and p-Akt, as well as collagen-I synthesis and cell proliferation in lung fibroblasts and pleural mesothelial cells (PMCs). TGF-beta1 signaling mediated CSE-induced PMCs migration. Moreover, in vitro studies revealed that CSE had superimposed effect on bleomycin-induced activation of TGF-beta-Smad2/3 and -Akt signaling. TGF-beta-Smad2/3 and -Akt signaling were further augmented by cigarette smoking in the lung of bleomycin-treated mice. Taken together, these findings represent the first evidence that cigarette smoking aggravated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis via TGF-beta1 signaling.

30578841|t|Corynoxine B ameliorates HMGB1-dependent autophagy dysfunction during manganese exposure in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells.
30578841|a|Manganese (Mn) has recently come into the limelight as an important environmental risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders. Although multiple neurotoxicity of Mn have been extensively studied, the exact mechanism of Mn-induced autophagic dysregulation is still poorly understood. The main aim of this study was to explore the role of cytosolic high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1)-dependent autophagy in Mn-induced autophagic dysregulation and neurotoxicity. SH-SY5Y cells were treated with culture solution (control) and three different concentrations of Mn (50, 100, and 200 muM) for 24 h to detect the effect of Mn on HMGB1-dependent autophagy. We found Mn could increase the HMGB1 mRNA level and its cytosolic translocation and dysregulate autophagy, and Mn-induced alpha-synuclein overexpression interfered with the interaction of HMGB1 and Beclin1, to subsequently promote Beclin1 binding to Bcl2. Another important finding was the neuroprotective role of corynoxine B (Cory B) in Mn-induced autophagic dysregulation and neurotoxicity. We set up six experimental groups: control (culture solution); 200 muM Mn treatment; 100 muM Cory B-alone treatment; and three different pretreated concentrations of Cory B (25, 50, and 100 muM). Our results showed that Cory B ameliorated Mn-induced autophagic dysregulation and neurotoxicity partly by dissociating HMGB1 from alpha-synuclein and inhibiting mTOR signaling.

30582900|t|Action of corilagin on hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and oxidative stress in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.
30582900|a|Diabetes mellitus is the world's most common endocrine disease involving metabolic disorders of carbohydrate, protein and fat. This study was undertaken to investigate the anti-diabetic activity of corilagin, a member of polyphenolic tannins used against hyperglycemia and many other diseases in well-known animal models. Diabetes was induced chemically by intraperitoneal administration of Streptozotocin (40 mg/kg bw) to albino Wistar rats. Diabetic rats showed significant increase in the levels of fasting blood glucose, glycated haemoglobin, total cholesterol, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, very low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and a significant decrease in the level of body weight, plasma insulin, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, antioxidant activities, viz. superoxide dismutase, catalase and reduced glutathione when compared to controls. However, after 30 days of oral administration of corilagin (10 and 20 mg/kg bw/day) to these diabetic rats evoked significant alterations in the above mentioned parameters. The effect of corilagin was compared with the standard drug, glibenclamide (0.1 mg/kg body weight/day). Thus, the present study suggests that the corilagin acts as a natural, effective therapeutic agent to regulate diabetes, by exhibiting antidiabetic, antihyperlipidemic and antioxidant properties in STZ induced diabetic rats.

30582956|t|Profiling of bisphenol A and eight its analogues on transcriptional activity via human nuclear receptors.
30582956|a|Several bisphenol A (BPA) analogues have been detected in environmental samples, foodstuffs, and/or human biological samples, and there is concern regarding their potential endocrine-disrupting effects. In this study, we characterized the agonistic and/or antagonistic activities of BPA and eight its analogues against human estrogen receptors (ERalpha/beta), androgen receptor (AR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), pregnane X receptor (PXR), and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). All the test compounds, except for bisphenol P (BPP), showed both ERalpha and ERbeta agonistic activities, with bisphenol AF (BPAF) being the most potent. On the other hand, BPAF and BPP showed ERalpha and ERbeta antagonistic activities. Interestingly, their ER activities demonstrated a preference toward ERbeta. All the test compounds, except for bisphenol S, showed AR antagonistic activities, with bisphenol E being the most potent. Weak GR antagonistic activities were also found in BPA and five its analogues. PXR agonistic activity was observed in the six compounds, with bisphenol Z being the most potent. Results of the CAR assay revealed that BPA and five its analogues acted as CAR inverse agonists. Taken together, these results suggested that BPA analogues demonstrate multiple effects via human nuclear receptors in a similar manner to BPA, and several analogues might have more potent endocrine-disrupting activity than does BPA.

30590068|t|Involvement of brain GABAAR-coupled Cl-/HCO3--ATPase in phenol-induced the head-twitching and tremor responses in rats.
30590068|a|Phenol-induced neurotoxicity manifests as twitching/tremor and convulsions, but its molecular mechanisms underlying the behavioral responses remain unclear. We assessed the role of the brain Cl-/HCO3--ATPase in behavioral responses in rats following an in vivo intraperitoneal injection of phenol (20-160 mg/kg). Low concentrations of phenol (20-80 mg/kg) increased the ATPase activity as well as the head twitching responses in rat, whereas higher phenol concentrations (>60 mg/kg) increased the tremor but reduced the ATPase activity. At phenol concentrations >120 mg/kg, no ATPase activity was detected. Phenobarbital (10 mg/kg) and picrotoxin (1 mg/kg) as well as o-vanadate (2 mg/kg), significantly prevented (~55-70%) the phenol-induced change in the behavioral responses and completely restored the enzyme activity. In vitro experiments confirmed that phenol stimulated the Cl-/HCO3--ATPase activity at low concentrations, but had no stimulating effect on other transport ATPases. Low doses of phenol increased the formation of phosphoprotein and the rate of ATP-consuming Cl- transport by the reconstituted enzyme. The present findings provide evidence that phenol-induced neurotoxicity involves the Cl-/HCO3--ATPase in the behavioral responses in mammals and indicate the potential benefit of this enzyme as a target for the treatment of head twitching and other types of tremor diseases.

30590302|t|Bisphenol AF exerts estrogenic activity in MCF-7 cells through activation of Erk and PI3K/Akt signals via GPER signaling pathway.
30590302|a|The negative health effects of bisphenol A (BPA) due to its estrogenic activity result in the increasing usage of alternative bisphenols (BPs) including bisphenol AF (BPAF). To comprehensive understand health effects of BPAF, the MCF-7 cells were used to investigate the effects of BPAF on cell proliferation, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, and calcium ion (Ca2+) level. The molecular mechanisms of cell biological responses caused by BPAF were investigated by analyzing target protein expression. The results showed that low-concentration BPAF induces significant effects on MCF-7 cells, including promoting cell proliferation and elevating intracellular ROS and Ca2+ levels. BPAF in low concentration significantly enhances the protein expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), G protein-coupled receptor (GPER), c-Myc, and Cyclin D1, as well as increases phosphorylation levels of protein kinase B (Akt) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) in MCF-7 cells. After the addition of ERalpha, GPER, and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors, phosphorylations of Erk and Akt were both inhibited. In addition, specific signal inhibitors significantly attenuated the effects of BPAF. Silencing of GPER also markedly decreased BPAF induced cell proliferation. The present results suggested that BPAF can activate PI3K/Akt and Erk signals via GPER, which, in turn, stimulate cellular biological effects induced by BPAF. ERalpha also plays a critical role in BPAF induced cellular biological effects.

30594692|t|Multigenerational consequences of early-life cannabinoid exposure in zebrafish.
30594692|a|While Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) has been widely studied in the realm of developmental and reproductive toxicology, few studies have investigated potential toxicities from a second widely used cannabis constituent, cannabidiol (CBD). CBD is popularized for its therapeutic potential for reducing seizure frequencies in epilepsy. This study investigated developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) via multigenerational gene expression patterns, behavior phenotypes, and reproductive fitness of a subsequent F1 following an F0 developmental exposure of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to THC (0.024, 0.12, 0.6 mg/L; 0.08, 0.4, 2 muM) or CBD (0.006, 0.03, 0.15 mg/L; 0.02, 0.1, 0.5 muM). Embryonic exposure at these concentrations did not cause notable morphological abnormalities in either F0 or F1 generations. However, during key developmental stages (14, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h post fertilization) THC and CBD caused differential expression of c-fos, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf), and deleted-in-azoospermia like (dazl), while in F1 larvae only CBD differentially expressed dazl. Larval photomotor behavior was reduced (F0) or increased (F1) by THC exposure, while CBD had no effect on F0 larvae, but decreased activity in the unexposed F1 larvae. These results support our hypothesis of cannabinoid-related developmental neurotoxicity. As adults, F0 fecundity was reduced, but it was not in F1 adults. Conversely, in the adult open field test there were no significant effects in F0 fish, but a significant reduction in the time in periphery was seen in F1 fish from the highest THC exposure group. The results highlight the need to consider long-term ramifications of early-life exposure to cannabinoids.

30597128|t|The ion channel activator CyPPA inhibits melanogenesis via the GSK3beta/beta-catenin pathway.
30597128|a|Research into materials that inhibit melanogenesis in skin has gained interest. Screening for such compounds in B16F10 cells revealed that cyclohexyl-[2-(3,5-dimethyl-pyrazol-1-yl)-6-methyl-pyrimidin-4-yl]-amine (CyPPA), a positive modulator of small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels, is a strong inhibitor of melanogenesis. We investigated the anti-melanogenic activity of CyPPA and the molecular mechanism by which CyPPA reduced melanin production in normal human melanocytes (NHM). CyPPA treatment resulted in a significant concentration-dependent reduction in melanin content without significant cytotoxicity; treatment likewise resulted in a significant time-dependent reduction in tyrosinase (TYR) activity. Treatment with CyPPA also decreased transcription of melanogenesis-related genes, including the gene encoding microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). In addition, visual evaluation of the MelanoDerm  human skin model revealed significantly lower melanin content in the CyPPA-treated condition than in the untreated control. CyPPA was determined to modulate glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) activity, thereby leading to a decrease in beta-catenin/MITF expression. Thus, CyPPA acts as a melanogenesis inhibitor by modulating the GSK3beta/beta-catenin/MITF pathway.

30610963|t|Anandamide down-regulates placental transporter expression through CB2 receptor-mediated inhibition of cAMP synthesis.
30610963|a|The BCRP/ABCG2 efflux transporter is expressed on the membrane of placental syncytiotrophoblasts and protects the fetus from toxicant exposure. Syncytiotrophoblasts arise from the fusion of cytotrophoblasts, a process negatively regulated by the endocannabinoid, anandamide (AEA). It is unknown whether AEA can influence fetal concentrations of xenobiotics by modulating the expression of transporters in syncytiotrophoblasts. Here, we sought to characterize and identify the mechanism(s) responsible for AEA-mediated down-regulation of the BCRP transporter in human placental explants and BeWo trophoblasts. Treatment of human placental explants with AEA (1 muM, 24 h) reduced hCGalpha, syncytin-1, and BCRP mRNAs by ~30%. Similarly, treatment of BeWo trophoblasts with AEA (0-10 muM, 3-24 h) coordinately down-regulated mRNAs for hCGss, syncytin-2, and BCRP. In turn, AEA increased the sensitivity of trophoblasts to the cytotoxicity of mitoxantrone, a known BCRP substrate, and environmental and dietary contaminants including mycoestrogens and perfluorinated chemicals. AEA-treated trophoblasts also demonstrated reduced BCRP transport of the mycoestrogen zearalenone and the diabetes drug glyburide, labeled with BODIPY. The AEA-mediated reduction of BCRP mRNA was abrogated when placental cells were co-treated with AM630, a CB2 receptor inhibitor, or 8-Br-cAMP, a cAMP analog. AEA reduced intracellular cAMP levels in trophoblasts by 75% at 1 h, and completely inhibited forskolin-induced phosphorylation of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). AEA also decreased p-CREB binding to the BCRP promoter. Taken together, our data indicate that AEA down-regulates placental transporter expression and activity via CB2-cAMP signaling. This novel mechanism may explain the repression of placental BCRP expression observed during diseases of pregnancy.

30612929|t|KML001, an arsenic compound, as salvage chemotherapy in refractory biliary tract cancers: A prospective study.
30612929|a|BACKGROUND: Sodium meta-arsenite (NaAsO2, KML001) is a potential oral anticancer agent acting on telomerase and telomere length. This prospective study evaluated its safety, tolerability, and effectiveness as salvage chemotherapy in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC) resistant to gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. METHODS: Forty-four patients (21 women and 23 men) with advanced BTC and failure history of gemcitabine-based chemotherapy, performance status (PS) 0-2, normal cardiac, hepatic, and renal function were enrolled. Daily dose of KML001 (7.5 mg. p.o.) was administered to eligible subjects for 24 weeks divided into six treatment cycles. Response was evaluated bimonthly using CT. RESULTS: After an average of 1.5 months of treatment (range: 0.5-10.0), 3 patients (6.8%) obtained progression-free status, 23 patients (52.3%) had disease progression, and 18 patients (40.9%) dropped out before evaluation. One patient (2.3%) completed six treatment cycles without progression. During the treatment, morphine dosage kept the same or decreased in 20 patients (47.6%). Nine patients (20.5%) experienced grade-3 adverse events (AEs), while no patient experienced grade-4 AEs. The most common AEs were liver enzyme elevation (11/44, 25%) and anemia (10/44, 22.7%). KML001 was discontinued in six patients (13.6%) due to AEs, including liver toxicity (n = 3), QTc prolongation (n = 2), and abdominal pain (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: KML001 did not have enough anticancer effect on patients with advanced BTC resistant to gemcitabine. However, KML001 was safe and well-tolerable in terms of AEs and pain control when used as salvage therapy. Further studies are needed to establish arsenic agents as a reliable treatment option in patients with BTC.

30615409|t|Long-Term Exposure to Environmental Concentrations of Azoxystrobin Delays Sexual Development and Alters Reproduction in Zebrafish ( Danio rerio).
30615409|a|The strobilurin fungicide azoxystrobin (AZO) can induce adverse effects in aquatic organisms, but data are lacking on endpoints associated with sexual development and reproduction following chronic exposure to AZO. In this study, zebrafish embryos (F0) at 2-4 h postfertilization (hpf) were exposed to 0.2, 2.0, and 20.0 mug/L AZO until 120 d postfertilization (dpf). Decreased male ratio and increased intersex ratio were observed by 20.0 mug/L AZO at 42 and 60 dpf, but this effect disappeared at 120 dpf. AZO at 20.0 mug/L inhibited growth, retarded gonadal development, and disrupted sex hormone and vitellogenin in females at 60 and 120 dpf and in males at 42, 60, and 120 dpf. These effects were associated with altered expression of cyp19a, cyp19b, hsd3b, hsd17b, vtg1, and vtg2. Exposure to 2.0 mug/L AZO altered mRNA levels of these transcripts in females at 120 dpf and in males at 60 and 120 dpf. Reproduction ability was reduced by 20.0 mug/L AZO at 120 dpf. Developmental defects were observed after F1 embryos from exposed parents of 20.0 mug/L were reared in AZO-free water at 96 hpf. Overall, these data provide new understanding of fish sexual development and reproduction following chronic exposures to AZO.

30615907|t|Bisphenol A induces human uterine leiomyoma cell proliferation through membrane-associated ERalpha36 via nongenomic signaling pathways.
30615907|a|The role of ERalpha36 in regulating BPA's effects and its potential as a risk factor for human uterine fibroids were evaluated. BPA at low concentrations (10-6 muM - 10 muM) increased proliferation by facilitating progression of hormonally regulated, immortalized human uterine leiomyoma (ht-UtLM; fibroid) cells from G0-G1 into S phase of the cell cycle; whereas, higher concentrations (100 muM-200 muM) decreased growth. BPA upregulated ERalpha36 gene and protein expression, and induced increased SOS1 and Grb2 protein expression, both of which are mediators of the MAPKp44/42/ERK1/2 pathway. EGFR (pEGFR), Ras, and MAPKp44/42 were phosphorylated with concurrent Src activation in ht-UtLM cells within 10 min of BPA exposure. BPA enhanced colocalization of phosphorylated Src (pSrc) to ERalpha36 and coimmunoprecipitation of pSrc with pEGFR. Silencing ERalpha36 with siERalpha36 abolished the above effects. BPA induced proliferation in ht-UtLM cells through membrane-associated ERalpha36 with activation of Src, EGFR, Ras, and MAPK nongenomic signaling pathways.

30626086|t|Bamboo Stems (Phyllostachys nigra variety henosis) Containing Polyphenol Mixtures Activate Nrf2 and Attenuate Phenylhydrazine-Induced Oxidative Stress and Liver Injury.
30626086|a|This study was designed to investigate the hepatoprotective effect of bamboo stems using in vitro and in vivo experimental liver damage models. Ethyl acetate fraction of 80% ethanol extract of Phyllostachys nigra stem (PN3) containing polyphenols had a higher NQO1-ARE reporter gene activity as monitored by the activity of the NF-E2-related factor (Nrf2) antioxidant pathway in cells in comparison to extracts from other species and under other conditions. The Nrf2 was translocated from the cytosol to the nucleus in response to PN3, followed by induction of the Nrf2 target gene expression, including HO-1, GCL, and NQO-1 in HepG2 cells. Phosphorylation of Nrf2 in HepG2 cells was enhanced in PN3, which was mediated by PKCdelta, ERK, and p38 MAPK. Consequently, PN3 inhibited arachidonic acid (AA) + iron-induced reactive oxygen species generation and glutathione depletion, and, thus, highlighted their role in cytotoxicity. Treatment with major polyphenols of PN3, including catechin, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and p-coumaric acid, also improved AA + iron-mediated oxidative stress and, thus, improved cell viability. Treatment with phenylhydrazine in mice, i.e., the iron overload liver injury model, increased plasma alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels and changed histological features in mice-a response that was almost completely blocked by PN3 administration. Moreover, PN3 extract mitigated phenylhydrazine-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. Conclusively, PN3 can exert a hepatoprotective effect against iron overload-induced acute liver damage due to its antioxidant properties.

30626778|t|Dermal exposure to nano-TiO2 induced cardiovascular toxicity through oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis.
30626778|a|Due to its excellent properties such as ultraviolet obscuration, chemical stability and small particle size, nano-titanium dioxide (nano-TiO2) is widely used, particularly in sunblock products. The skin is therefore a chief route for exposure. Studies have found that oral or respiratory exposure to nano-TiO2 has an adverse impact on the cardiovascular system. The relationship between dermal exposure to nano-TiO2 and cardiovascular system toxicity, particularly the causative mechanisms, remain unclear. In this study, we used Balb/c mice to evaluate cardiovascular toxicity from nano-TiO2 dermal exposure, and the underlying mechanisms associated with the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were explored. Our results showed that nano-TiO2 treatment resulted in an obvious increase in reactive oxygen species and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, indicating the appearance of oxidative stress. Moreover, the levels of inflammatory biomarkers, such as immunoglobulin E, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, interleukin-8, and hypersensitive C-reactive protein, also increased. Exposing HUVECs to nano-TiO2 led to a decline in cell vitality, and an increase in caspase-3 levels, suggesting that nano-TiO2 exposure caused cytotoxicity and even cell apoptosis. Interestingly, neutralizing oxidative stress by administering Vitamin E was shown to reduce the inflammatory response and cytotoxicity. Our findings suggest that nano-TiO2 can injure the cardiovascular system via dermal exposure, and does this via oxidative stress-induced inflammation and cytotoxicity. Vitamin E treatment may be a strategy to mitigate the damage.

30629241|t|Involvement of Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor-Alpha in Liver Tumor Production by Permethrin in the Female Mouse.
30629241|a|The nongenotoxic pyrethroid insecticide permethrin produced hepatocellular tumors in CD-1 mice but not in Wistar rats. Recently, based on findings of a Pathology Working Group involving an expert panel of pathologists, it was concluded that permethrin increased liver tumors at 2500 and 5000 ppm in female mice, but no treatment-related tumorigenic response occurred in male mice at dose levels examined in the 2-year bioassay. To evaluate a possible mode of action (MOA) for the permethrin female CD-1 mouse hepatocellular tumors, a number of investigative studies were conducted. In time-course studies in female CD-1 mice, permethrin increased relative liver weight and enhanced hepatocyte proliferation within 1 week. Treatment with permethrin resulted in marked increases in CYP4A enzyme activities and mRNA levels, but only slightly increased CYP2B markers, suggesting that permethrin primarily activates the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) and to a much lesser extent the constitutive androstane receptor. The effects of permethrin on relative liver weight, hepatocyte proliferation and CYP4A enzyme activities and mRNA levels were dose-dependent and were reversible within 5 weeks after cessation of treatment. The hepatic effects of permethrin observed in wild-type female mice were markedly reduced in PPARalpha knockout female mice. These results demonstrate that the MOA for hepatocellular tumor formation by permethrin in female mice involves activation of PPARalpha resulting in a mitogenic effect. The MOA for permethrin-induced mouse liver tumor formation due to PPARalpha activation is considered to be not plausible for humans. This conclusion is strongly supported by available epidemiological data for permethrin.

30629669|t|The validation of Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements (SINEs) as a RT-qPCR normalization strategy in a rodent model for temporal lobe epilepsy.
30629669|a|BACKGROUND: In gene expression studies via RT-qPCR many conclusions are inferred by using reference genes. However, it is generally known that also reference genes could be differentially expressed between various tissue types, experimental conditions and animal models. An increasing amount of studies have been performed to validate the stability of reference genes. In this study, two rodent-specific Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements (SINEs), which are located throughout the transcriptome, were validated and assessed against nine reference genes in a model of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE). Two different brain regions (i.e. hippocampus and cortex) and two different disease stages (i.e. acute phase and chronic phase) of the systemic kainic acid rat model for TLE were analyzed by performing expression analyses with the geNorm and NormFinder algorithms. Finally, we performed a rank aggregation analysis and validated the reference genes and the rodent-specific SINEs (i.e. B elements) individually via Gfap gene expression. RESULTS: GeNorm ranked Hprt1, Pgk1 and Ywhaz as the most stable genes in the acute phase, while Gusb and B2m were ranked as the most unstable, being significantly upregulated. The two B elements were ranked as most stable for both brain regions in the chronic phase by geNorm. In contrast, NormFinder ranked the B1 element only once as second best in cortical tissue for the chronic phase. Interestingly, using only one of the two algorithms would have led to skewed conclusions. Finally, the rank aggregation method indicated the use of the B1 element as the best option to normalize target genes, independent of the disease progression and brain region. This result was supported by the expression profile of Gfap. CONCLUSION: In this study, we demonstrate the potential of implementing SINEs -notably the B1 element- as a stable normalization factor in a rodent model of TLE, independent of brain region or disease progression.

30629985|t|The impact of subchronic low-dose exposure to nonylphenol on depression-like behaviors in high-sucrose and high-fat diet induced rats.
30629985|a|OBJECTIVE: We investigated the impact of subchronic low-dose exposure to nonylphenol (NP) on depression-like behaviors and synaptic morphological plasticity in the context of a high-sucrose/high-fat diet in rats. METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into 8 groups (n = 10 per group), as follows: rats fed a normal-diet (ND), as the control (C-ND); rats fed a normal diet and gavaged with NP at a dose of 0.02 mg/kg/day (NP-L-ND), 0.2 mg/kg/day (NP-M-ND) or 2 mg/kg/day (NP-H-ND); rats fed a high-sucrose/high-fat diet (HSHFD), as the HSHFD control (C-HSHFD); rats fed a HSHFD and gavaged with NP at a dose of 0.02 mg/kg/day (NP-L-HSHFD), 0.2 mg/kg/day (NP-M-HSHFD) or 2 mg/kg/day (NP-H-HSHFD). Elevated plus maze was used to evaluate anxiety behavior. Open field test was used to evaluate locomotor activity. Cyclooxygenase-2 expression in hippocampal tissue was measured by immunohistochemistry. The ultrastructure of hippocampal mitochondria and the synaptic plasticity were observed by transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: Significant interactions between HSHFD and NP-H were observed, reflected by the time spent exploring the open arms, time spent in the center area, distance traveled in the center area and total distance traveled (p &lt;  0.05). Exposure to NP-H-HSHFD resulted in swelling of the mitochondria, associated with an increased number of disordered and partially disrupted cristae compared with the control group. Synaptic interface curvatures and postsynaptic density thickness decreased as the NP dose increased among the treatment groups. Co-exposure to HSHFD and NP showed an increase in synaptic cleft width compared with the HSHFD-only and NP-only exposure groups (p &lt; 0.05). COX-2 expression and integral optical density value increased as the NP dose increased among the NP treatment groups (p &lt;  0.05). CONCLUSION: Subchronic low-dose exposure to NP might induce alterations in depression-like behaviors, synaptic morphological plasticity and COX-2 expression in the hippocampus. Co-exposure to NP and HSHFD had significantly more dissimilarities.

30639440|t|Combined treatment with vitamin K2 and PTH enhanced bone formation in ovariectomized rats and increased differentiation of osteoblast in vitro.
30639440|a|Osteoporosis is accompanied by insufficient osteogenic capacity. Several lines of evidence suggested that solutions to enhance osteoblastogenesis were important strategies for osteoporotic bone defect repair. This study investigated the effect of combined treatment with vitamin K2 and PTH on bone formation in calvarial bone defect in osteoporotic rats and its influence on osteoblast in vitro. Bilateral ovariectomy was used in SPF Sprague Dawley rats to generate an osteoporosis model. Subsequently, a calvarial defect model was established and all osteoporotic rats were randomly assigned to the following groups: control, VK (vitamin K2, 30 mg/kg everyday), PTH (recombinant human PTH (1-34), 60 mug/kg, three times a week) or VK + PTH (vitamin K2, 30 mg/kg everyday plus PTH, 60 mug/kg three times a week) for 8 weeks. In vitro, bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs) were cultured and treated with vitamin K2, PTH or vitamin K2+PTH. ALP staining and western blot were performed to observe the influence of combined treatment on BMSCs. Bone formation within calvarial defect were assessed by serum gamma-carboxylated osteocalcin (Gla-OC), micro-CT, histological and immunofluorescent labeling. In this study, combined treatment of PTH and vitamin K2 showed positive effects on preventing bone loss in femurs in OVX rats. Combined treatment increased serum Gla-OC and promoted bone formation in osteoporotic calvarial bone defects. Immunohistochemistry showed that OCN and RUNX2 were more highly expressed in the VK + PTH group than in the control groups. In vitro studies results suggested that combined treatment with PTH and vitamin K2 increased expression of ALP, BMP2 and RUNX2 in BMSCs. Our data suggested that the combination of vitamin K2 and PTH increased differentiation of osteoblast and had a synergistic effect on bone formation in osteoporotic calvarial bone defect.

30639578|t|Aconitum alkaloids induce cardiotoxicity and apoptosis in embryonic zebrafish by influencing the expression of cardiovascular relative genes.
30639578|a|Aconitine (AC) and mesaconitine (MA) are major bioactive diterpenoid alkaloids derived from herbal aconitum plants. Emerging evidence indicates that AC plays a pivotal role in the cardiotoxicity for aconite poisoning. However, the cardiotoxicity data of MA, especially those on the difference between AC and MA are quite limited. Zebrafish embryos were used in this study for toxicological screening, and the cardiac morphology and function were observed. Embryos were analyzed by means of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) after exposure and pharmacokinetic behaviors were also investigated. Results showed that 1.5% of the aconitum alkaloids penetrated into the zebrafish embryos. 2.5 mug/L AC and 20 mug/L MA caused a deficient cardiovascular system with yolk sac hemorrhage and early cardiac dysfunctions were observed in 96 h post-fertilization. AC showed greater cardiotoxicity than MA by comparing the EC50 of pericardium edema. Aconitum alkaloids exposure also resulted in a significant decrease in the expression of cardiac genes (Tbx5, Gata4, and Nkx2.5) from an early stage (12-24 hpf), which may partly explained that the death caused by aconitum is most likely to occur within the first 24 h. In addition, a high percentage of apoptotic cells was observed in the brain region, which identified another potential target of the DDA action in zebrafish embryos.

30639747|t|The retinoic acid receptor (RAR) in molluscs: Function, evolution and endocrine disruption insights.
30639747|a|Retinoid acid receptor (RAR)-dependent signalling pathways are essential for the regulation and maintenance of essential biological functions and are recognized targets of disruptive anthropogenic compounds. Recent studies put forward the inability of mollusc RARs to bind and respond to the canonical vertebrate ligand, retinoic acid: a feature that seems to have been lost during evolution. Yet, these studies were carried out in a limited number of molluscs. Therefore, using an in vitro transactivation assay, the present work aimed to characterize phylogenetically relevant mollusc RARs, as monomers or as functional units with RXR, not only in the presence of vertebrate bone fine ligands but also known endocrine disruptors, described to modulate retinoid-dependent pathways. In general, none of the tested mollusc RARs were able to activate reporter gene transcription when exposed to retinoic acid isomers, suggesting that the ability to respond to retinoic acid was lost across molluscs. Similarly, the analysed mollusc RAR were unresponsive towards organochloride pesticides. In contrast, transcriptional repressions were observed with the RAR/RXR unit upon exposure to retinoids or RXR-specific ligands. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations further corroborate the obtained results and suggest that the repressive behaviour, observed with mollusc and human RAR/RXR heterodimers, is possibly mediated by ligand biding to RXR.

30654191|t|The Modulatory Role of MicroRNA-873 in the Progression of KRAS-Driven Cancers.
30654191|a|KRAS is one of the most frequently mutated proto-oncogenes in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and aberrantly activated in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). A profound role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathogenesis of human cancer is being uncovered, including in cancer therapy. Using in silico prediction algorithms, we identified miR-873 as a potential regulator of KRAS, and we investigated its role in PDAC and TNBC. We found that reduced miR-873 expression is associated with shorter patient survival in both cancers. miR-873 expression is significantly repressed in PDAC and TNBC cell lines and inversely correlated with KRAS levels. We demonstrate that miR-873 directly bound to the 3' UTR of KRAS mRNA and suppressed its expression. Notably, restoring miR-873 expression induced apoptosis; recapitulated the effects of KRAS inhibition on cell proliferation, colony formation, and invasion; and suppressed the activity of ERK and PI3K/AKT, while overexpression of KRAS rescued the effects mediated by miR-873. Moreover, in vivo delivery of miR-873 nanoparticles inhibited KRAS expression and tumor growth in PDAC and TNBC tumor models. In conclusion, we provide the first evidence that miR-873 acts as a tumor suppressor by targeting KRAS and that miR-873-based gene therapy may be a therapeutic strategy in PDAC and TNBC.

30658076|t|Aberrant expression of miR-125a-3p promotes fibroblast activation via Fyn/STAT3 pathway during silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis.
30658076|a|Various miRNAs are dysregulated during initiation and progression of pulmonary fibrosis. However, their function remains limited in silicosis. Here, we observed that miR-125a-3p was downregulated in silica-induced fibrotic murine lung tissues. Ectopic miR-125a-3p expression with chemotherapy attenuated silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Further in vitro experiments revealed that TGF-beta1 effectively decreased miR-125a-3p expression in fibroblast lines (NIH/3T3 and MRC-5). Overexpression of miR-125a-3p blocked fibroblast activation stimulated by TGF-beta1. Mechanistically, miR-125a-3p could bind to the 3'-untranslated region of Fyn and inhibit its expression in both mRNA and protein levels, thus causing inactivation of Fyn downstream effector STAT3. Fyn and p-STAT3, as opposed to miR-125a-3p expression, were elevated in silica-induced fibrotic murine lung tissues and TGF-beta1-treated fibroblast lines. Furthermore, Fyn knockdown or p-STAT3 suppression effectively attenuated fibroblast activation and ECM production. Taken together, miR-125a-3p is involved in fibrosis pathogenesis by fibroblast activation, suggesting that targeting miR-125a-3p/Fyn/STAT3 signaling pathway could be a potential therapeutic approach for pulmonary fibrosis.

30660623|t|In utero exposure to di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate suppresses blood glucose and leptin levels in the offspring of wild-type mice.
30660623|a|Exposure of pregnant mice to di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) induces maternal lipid malnutrition and decreases the number of live fetuses/pups. In this study, we aimed to clarify the relationship between maternal lipid malnutrition and the nutritional status of the neonatal, lactational, and adult offspring, as well as the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) in these relationships. Sv/129 wild-type (mPPARA), Ppara-null, and PPARalpha-humanized (hPPARA) mice were fed diets containing 0, 0.01, 0.05, or 0.1% DEHP in utero and/or during the lactational stage. The male offspring were killed on postnatal day 2 or 21, or after 11 weeks. Exposure to either 0.05% or 0.1% DEHP during both the in utero and lactational periods decreased serum glucose concentrations in 2-day-old mPPARA offspring. These dosages also decreased both serum and plasma leptin levels in both 2- and 21-day-old mPPARA offspring. In contrast, exposure to DEHP only during the lactational period did not decrease leptin levels, suggesting the importance of in utero exposure to DEHP. Exposure to 0.05% DEHP during the in utero and lactational periods also increased food consumption after weaning in both mPPARA and hPPARA mice; this was not observed in Ppara-null offspring. In conclusion, in utero exposure to DEHP induces neonatal serum glucose malnutrition via PPARalpha. DEHP also decreases serum and plasma leptin concentrations in offspring during the neonatal and weaning periods, in association with PPARalpha, which presumably results in increased of food consumption after weaning.

30661753|t|Environmental Control of Astrocyte Pathogenic Activities in CNS Inflammation.
30661753|a|Genome-wide studies have identified genetic variants linked to neurologic diseases. Environmental factors also play important roles, but no methods are available for their comprehensive investigation. We developed an approach that combines genomic data, screens in a novel zebrafish model, computational modeling, perturbation studies, and multiple sclerosis (MS) patient samples to evaluate the effects of environmental exposure on CNS inflammation. We found that the herbicide linuron amplifies astrocyte pro-inflammatory activities by activating signaling via sigma receptor 1, inositol-requiring enzyme-1alpha (IRE1alpha), and X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1). Indeed, astrocyte-specific shRNA- and CRISPR/Cas9-driven gene inactivation combined with RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, and study of patient samples suggest that IRE1alpha-XBP1 signaling promotes CNS inflammation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and, potentially, MS. In summary, these studies define environmental mechanisms that control astrocyte pathogenic activities and establish a multidisciplinary approach for the systematic investigation of the effects of environmental exposure in neurologic disorders.

30664622|t|The autism/neuroprotection-linked ADNP/NAP regulate the excitatory glutamatergic synapse.
30664622|a|Activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP), essential for brain formation, was discovered as a leading de novo mutated gene causing the autism-like ADNP syndrome. This syndrome is phenotypically characterized by global developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, speech impediments, and motor dysfunctions. The Adnp haploinsufficient mouse mimics the human ADNP syndrome in terms of synapse density and gene expression patterns, as well as in developmental, motor, and cognitive abilities. Peripheral ADNP was also discovered as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, with nasal administration of the ADNP snippet peptide NAP (enhancing endogenous ADNP activity) leading to partial cognitive and functional protection at the cellular, animal and clinical settings. Here, a novel formulation for effective delivery of NAP is provided with superior brain penetration capabilities. Also provided are methods for treating pertinent clinical implications such as autism, cognitive impairments, olfactory deficits, and muscle strength using the formulation in the Adnp haploinsufficient mouse. Results showed a dramatically specific increase in brain/body bioavailability with the new formulation, without breaching the blood brain barrier. Additional findings included improvements using daily intranasal treatments with NAP, at the behavioral and brain structural levels, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), translatable to clinical practice. Significant effects on hippocampal and cerebral cortical expression of the presynaptic Slc17a7 gene encoding vesicular excitatory glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) were observed at the RNA and immunohistochemical levels, explaining the DTI results. These findings tie for the first time a reduction in presynaptic glutamatergic synapses with the autism/Alzheimer's/schizophrenia-linked ADNP deficiency coupled with amelioration by NAP (CP201).

30668976|t|Insights into cellular metabolic pathways of the combined toxicity responses of Caco-2 cells exposed to deoxynivalenol, zearalenone and Aflatoxin B1.
30668976|a|Metabolic profiling in Caco-2 cells was studied for the combined toxic effects of deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZEN), and Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) through untargeted GC-MS. The GC-MS spectra of Caco-2 cells treated with individual 6.7 muM DON, 20 muM ZEN, 20 muM AFB1 and the combined DON + AFB1 (6.7 + 20 muM) and DON + ZEN + AFB1 (6.7 + 20 + 20 muM) for 24 h were deconvoluted, aligned and identified with MS DIAL. The metabolic pathway analysis was analyzed with MetaMapp and visualized with CytoScape. Results show that the combined DON + AFB1 and DON + ZEN + AFB1 treatment has an obvious "synergistic effect". The apoptosis-related gene mRNA test result indicates that the combined mycotoxins downregulate Bcl-2 gene and upregulate Bax, p53, caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-utilized 9 genes, more significantly than any individual mycotoxins group. The cellular metabolism illustrated that the combined mycotoxin groups, DON + ZEN + AFB1 seriously effect glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, etc. while no metabolic disorders were presented in individual mycotoxin group. Our hypothesis was validated that the combined mycotoxins with low concentrations can have a synergistic effect in the metabolism, which may lead to cellular apoptosis or necrosis.

30670679|t|Long Noncoding RNA (lncRNA) MIR22HG Suppresses Gastric Cancer Progression through Attenuating NOTCH2 Signaling.
30670679|a|BACKGROUND Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important regulators in human disease, including cancers. LncRNA MIR22HG has been shown to inhibit the progression of endometrial carcinoma, lung cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Its role in gastric cancer is unclear. This study investigated MIR22HG effects on gastric cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS Gastric cancer tissues (n=43) and adjacent normal tissues (n=21) were collected. Patients' 5-year overall survival rate was analyzed. Human normal gastric mucosal cell line (GES-1) and gastric cancer cell lines (MKN-45, AGS, SGC-7901) were cultured. AGS and MKN-45 cells were transfected by pcDNA3 empty vector, pcDNA3-MIR22HG overexpression vector, MIR22HG siRNA and its negative control, NOTCH2 siRNA and its negative control, respectively. Proliferation was explored by CCK-8 assay. Migration and invasion were explored by Transwell. qRT-PCR and western blot were used to investigate mRNA and proteins expression, respectively. RESULTS MIR22HG expression was decreased in gastric cancer tissues and cells (P&lt;0.05). Low MIR22HG expression indicated lower 5-year overall survival rate (P&lt;0.05). Upregulation of MIR22HG inhibited AGS and MKN-45 cell proliferation, migration and invasion (all P&lt;0.05). Downregulation of MIR22HG elevated AGS and MKN-45 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (all P&lt;0.05). MIR22HG negatively regulated NOTCH2 signaling. Silencing MIR22HG elevated HEY1 and nucleus NOTCH2 expression. Silencing of NOTCH2 suppressed AGS and MKN-45 cells proliferation, migration and invasion (all P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS LncRNA MIR22HG suppressed gastric cancer progression through attenuating NOTCH2 signaling.

30678553|t|First-line checkpoint inhibitors for wild-type advanced non-small-cell cancer: a pair-wise and network meta-analysis.
30678553|a|AIM: To estimate efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors and rank treatment effects in non-small-cell lung cancer. MATERIALS &amp; METHODS: Prospective randomized trials were included. p-score was used to rank treatment effects. RESULTS: A total of nine trials were identified, involving 5504 patients and three checkpoint inhibitors. Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy had the highest p-score of 0.95 among all the treatments, and was superior to pembrolizumab alone (hazard ratio: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.79-0.95). Combination therapy had more grade 3-5 adverse events; but toxicity-related discontinuation and treatment-related death did not increase. CONCLUSION: Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy was likely to be the most effective treatment for patients with wild-type advanced NSCLC.

30682438|t|Learning and memory impairments associated to acetylcholinesterase inhibition and oxidative stress following glyphosate based-herbicide exposure in mice.
30682438|a|Numerous clinical and epidemiological data have reported the deleterious effects of glyphosate on learning and memory. The ability of this herbicide to cross the blood-brain barrier may have adverse effects on the structure and various functions of the nervous system. This study was conducted to highlight the effects of Glyphosate-based herbicide (GBH) on these two functions in mice treated daily with 250 or 500 mg/kg following acute (unique administration), subchronic (6 weeks) and chronic (12 weeks) treatments. The integrity of learning and memory was assessed by using a specific behavioral test battery: Novel object recognition, Y-maze and passive avoidance tasks. The acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and anti-oxidant enzyme activities, especially superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (PO) were evaluated. Our results indicated that unlike acute treatment, both subchronic and chronic exposure to GBH decreased discrimination index and the step-through-latency indicating recognition and retention memory impairments, respectively. In contrast, only chronic exposure affected working memory manifested by decreased spontaneous alternation. Furthermore, our results showed also a prominent decrease in AChE, SOD and PO specific activities within the brain of treated mice following repeated exposures. This study demonstrates that GBH induced numerous cognitive abnormalities referred to different forms of memory likely associated with a significant inhibition of AChE activity and oxidative stress induction.

30682440|t|Prophylactic potential of memantine against soman poisoning in rats.
30682440|a|BACKGROUND: Carbamates physostigmine and pyridostigmine have been used as a pretreatment against poisoning with nerve agents in order to reversibly inhibit and thus protect from irreversible inhibition a portion of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in brain and respiratory muscles that is crucial for survival. Memantine, an adamantine derivative, has emerged as a promising alternative to carbamates, since it prevented the fasciculations and skeletal muscle necrosis induced by carbamates and organophosphates, including nerve agents. AIM: This experimental study was undertaken in order to investigate and compare the protective and behavioural effects of memantine and standard carbamates physostigmine and pyridostigmine in rats poisoned with soman and treated with atropine, oxime HI-6 and diazepam. Another goal was to elucidate the mechanisms of the antidotal effect of memantine and its potential synergism with standard antidotes against nerve agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Wistar rats were used throughout the experiments. In dose-finding experiments memantine was administered at dose interval 0-72 mg/kg sc 60 min before sc injection of soman. In time-finding experiments memantine was injected 18 mg/kg sc 0-1440 min before soman. Standard treatment antidotes - atropine 10 mg/kg, HI-6 50 mg/kg and diazepam 2.5 mg/kg - were administered im within 15 s post-exposure. Soman 0.75 LD50 was used to study its inhibitions of neuromuscular transmission on the phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparation in situ and of tissue AChE activity. Behavioural effects of the prophylactic antidotes were investigated by means of the rotarod test. Based on these data therapeutic index and therapeutic width was calculated for all three prophylactic agents. RESULTS: Memantine pretreatment (18 mg/kg sc) produced in rats poisoned with soman significantly better protective ratios (PRs) than the two carbamates - 1.25 when administered alone and 2.3 when combined with atropine pretreatment and 6.33 and 7.23 with atropine/HI-6 and atropine/HI-6/diazepam post-exposure therapy, respectively. The highest PR of 10.11 obtained in Atr/HI-6-treated rats was achieved after pretreatment with memantine 36 mg/kg. This additional protection lasted for 8 h. All three prophylactic regimens antagonised the soman-induced neuromuscular blockade, but the effect of memantine was fastest. Pretreatment with memantine assured higher AChE activity in brain and diaphragm than in unpretreated rats (46% vs 28% and 68% vs. 38%, respectively). All three prophylactic regimens affected the rotarod performance in rats, but the effect of memantine was relatively strongest. Memantine and pyridostigmine had lowest and highest therapeutic index and therapeutic width, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although memantine assures better and longer-lasting protection against soman poisoning in rats than the two carbamates, its small therapeutic index and narrow therapeutic width seriously limit its potential as a pretreatment agent. Despite its behavioural effects, memantine seems to be beneficial antidote when administered after soman, along with atropine/HI-6/diazepam therapy. Mechanism of the antidotal effect of memantine against soman poisoning appears to be a combination of AChE-protecting and NMDA receptor-blocking action.

30684957|t|Hospital-based screening to detect patients with cadmium nephropathy in cadmium-polluted areas in Japan.
30684957|a|BACKGROUND: In health examinations for local inhabitants in cadmium-polluted areas, only healthy people are investigated, suggesting that patients with severe cadmium nephropathy or itai-itai disease may be overlooked. Therefore, we performed hospital-based screening to detect patients with cadmium nephropathy in two core medical institutes in cadmium-polluted areas in Akita prefecture, Japan. METHODS: Subjects for this screening were selected from patients aged 60 years or older with elevated serum creatinine levels and no definite renal diseases. We enrolled 35 subjects from a hospital in Odate city and 22 from a clinic in Kosaka town. Urinary ss2-microglobulin and blood and urinary cadmium levels were measured. RESULTS: The criteria for renal tubular dysfunction and the over-accumulation of cadmium were set as a urinary ss2-microglobulin level higher than 10,000 mug/g cr. and a blood cadmium level higher than 6 mug/L or urinary cadmium level higher than 10 mug/g cr., respectively. Subjects who fulfilled both criteria were diagnosed with cadmium nephropathy. Six out of 57 patients (10.5% of all subjects) had cadmium nephropathy. CONCLUSIONS: This hospital-based screening is a very effective strategy for detecting patients with cadmium nephropathy in cadmium-polluted areas, playing a complementary role in health examinations for local inhabitants.

30698894|t|Vitamin D protects against particles-caused lung injury through induction of autophagy in an Nrf2-dependent manner.
30698894|a|Fine particulate matter is a well-known air pollutant threatening public health. Studies have confirmed long-term exposure to the particles could decrease the pulmonary function, induce asthma exacerbation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as increase the incidence and mortality of lung cancer. A clinical study has explored that the prevalence and risks of vitamin D (VD) deficiency in various chronic disease and toxins induced tissue damage. Our current study aimed to explore the mechanism and further therapeutic potential of VD administration to ameliorate fine particles exposure induced pulmonary damage in vivo and in vitro. To elucidate the effects and mechanisms of VD in particles-induced pulmonary damage, a murine model was established with fine particles intratracheal instillation along with VD intramuscular injection. Our study demonstrated that treatment with VD attenuated particles-induced pulmonary damage and promoted tissue repair by repressing of TGFbeta1 signaling pathway and upregulation of MMP9 expression. VD treatment could also regulate the autophagy-related signals along with activation of Nrf2 transcription factor. Furthermore, the results from the in vitro study demonstrated that VD protected against particles-induced cells' damage through the induction of autophagy in an Nrf2-dependent manner. VD treatment caused the degradation of P62 and its bound Keap1, which decreased the Nrf2 ubiquitination and increasing its protein stability. Our work explored a novel potential mechanism in the protection of VD in particles-induced pulmonary injury and tissue repair, and could further bring insights into exploring antifine particles exposure caused inflammation among other natural products and contributes to inflammation disease medical therapies.

30703377|t|Cell-specific regulation of Nrf2 during ROS-Dependent cell death caused by 2,3,5-tris(glutathion-S-yl)hydroquinone (TGHQ).
30703377|a|2,3,5-tris(Glutathion-S-yl)hydroquinone (TGHQ), a potent nephrotoxic and nephroncarcinogenic metabolite of benzene and hydroquinone, retains the ability to redox cycle and create oxidative stress. We have previously detected that TGHQ induces ROS-dependent necrotic or apoptotic cell death in renal epithelial HK-2 and human leukemic HL-60 cells respectively. Herein, we sought to determine the nature of the Nrf2 regulation in HK-2 and HL-60 cells undergoing TGHQ-mediated ROS-dependent cell death, due to the key role of Nrf2 in oxidative stress. Intriguingly, Nrf2 was upregulated in HK-2, but not in HL-60 cells, despite the ROS-dependent nature of cell death in both cell types. The possibility that TGHQ targeted the GSK3beta-dependent Nrf2 stabilization pathway in HL-60 cells was discounted, whereas TGHQ-induced decreases in Nrf2 phosphorylation at Ser40 site appears to partially underlie the inability of TGHQ to up-regulate Nrf2 expression in HL-60 cells. Moreover, whereas the TGHQ-induced post-translational stabilization of Nrf2 in HK-2 cells resulted in the expected upregulation of HO1 and NQO1 mRNA, TGHQ actually decreased Nrf2 mRNA in HL-60 cells, with a concomitant decrease in NQO1, but not HO1 mRNA. In summary, we define differences between the two cell types that might contribute to the engagement of the Nrf2 signaling pathways. By extension, these data provide evidence that Nrf2 is not necessarily activated in ROS-dependent cell death, and further delve into the knowledge that Nrf2 regulation sensing by cells might be achieved at solely transcriptional level, not related to its degradation.

30705370|t|Identification of recurrent fusion genes across multiple cancer types.
30705370|a|Chromosome changes are one of the hallmarks of human malignancies. Chromosomal rearrangement is frequent in human cancers. One of the consequences of chromosomal rearrangement is gene fusions in the cancer genome. We have previously identified a panel of fusion genes in aggressive prostate cancers. In this study, we showed that 6 of these fusion genes are present in 7 different types of human malignancies with variable frequencies. Among them, the CCNH-C5orf30 and TRMT11-GRIK2 gene fusions were found in breast cancer, colon cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, ovarian cancer and liver cancer, with frequencies ranging from 12.9% to 85%. In contrast, four other gene fusions (mTOR-TP53BP1, TMEM135-CCDC67, KDM4-AC011523.2 and LRRC59-FLJ60017) are less frequent. Both TRMT11-GRIK2 and CCNH-C5orf30 are also frequently present in lymph node metastatic cancer samples from the breast, colon and ovary. Thus, detecting these fusion transcripts may have significant biological and clinical implications in cancer patient management.

30710498|t|miR-543 inhibites cervical cancer growth and metastasis by targeting TRPM7.
30710498|a|Dysregulation of miR-543 has been implicated to play crucial roles in various human cancers. However, the function of miR-543 involved in cervical cancer (CC) progress remains largely unknown. Thus, this study aimed to explore the potential role of miR-543 and the underlying mechanisms in human CC. In this study, we found that miR-543 was significantly downregulated in 69 CC tissue samples and cell lines when compared to adjacent normal tissues and cell line. Decreased miR-543 was closely correlated with poor clinicopathological parameters including larger tumor size, late FIGO stage and lymph node metastasis. Overexpression of miR-543 in CC cell lines remarkably inhibited cell proliferation, invasion and migration, caused cell cycle arrest, promoted apoptosis in vitro, and suppressed tumor growth in vivo, whereas miR-543 inhibitor showed the opposite effect. Dual-luciferase assay validated that 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) was a direct binding site of miR-543. Rescue experiments showed that restoration of TRPM7 expression partially reversed the miR-543-mediated inhibition of proliferation and invasion in CC cells. Further studies confirmed that P13K/AKT and p38/MAPK signaling was involved in miR-543/TRPM7 axis mediated CC progression. Thus, these findings demonstrated the tumor suppressor role of miR-543 on CC progression, which might serve as a potential biomarker for CC diagnosis and therapy.

30715550|t|Constitutive Activation of NAD-Dependent Sirtuin 3 Plays an Important Role in Tumorigenesis of Chromium(VI)-Transformed Cells.
30715550|a|Chronic exposure of human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells to hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] causes malignant cell transformation. Sirtuin-3 (SIRT3) regulates mitochondrial adaptive response to stress, such as metabolic reprogramming and antioxidant defense mechanisms. In Cr(VI)-transformed cells, SIRT3 was upregulated and mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and proton leak were reduced. Knockdown of SIRT3 by its shRNA further decreased mitochondrial ATP production, proton leak, mitochondrial mass, and mitochondrial membrane potential, indicating that SIRT3 positively regulates mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and maintenance of mitochondrial integrity. Mitophagy is critical to maintain proper cellular functions. In Cr(VI)-transformed cells expressions of Pink 1 and Parkin, two mitophagy proteins, were elevated, and mitophagy remained similar as that in passage-matched normal BEAS-2B cells, indicating that in -Cr(VI)-transformed cells mitophagy is suppressed. Knockdown of SIRT3 induced mitophagy, suggesting that SIRT3 plays an important role in mitophagy suppression of Cr(VI)-transformed cells. In Cr(VI)-transformed cells, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) was constitutively activated, and protein levels of p62 and p-p62Ser349 were elevated. Knockdown of SIRT3 or treatment with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) decreased the binding of p-p62Ser349 to Keap1, resulting in increased binding of Keap1 to Nrf2 and consequently reduced Nrf2 activation. The results from CHIP assay showed that in Cr(VI)-transformed cells binding of Nrf2 to antioxidant response element (ARE) of SIRT3 gene promoter was dramatically increased. Knockdown of SIRT3 suppressed cell proliferation and tumorigenesis of Cr(VI)-transformed cells. Overexpression of SIRT3 in normal BEAS-2B cells exhibited mitophagy suppression phenotype and increased cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. The present study demonstrated that upregulation of SIRT3 causes mitophagy suppression and plays an important role in cell survival and tumorigenesis of Cr(VI)-transformed cells.

30716364|t|Regulation of Gpr173 expression, a putative phoenixin receptor, by saturated fatty acid palmitate and endocrine-disrupting chemical bisphenol A through a p38-mediated mechanism in immortalized hypothalamic neurons.
30716364|a|GPR173 is a highly conserved G protein coupled receptor associated with the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal reproductive axis. It is expressed in the brain and ovaries, however considerable knowledge about its function remains unknown. One putative ligand for this receptor is phoenixin (PNX), a newly identified reproductive peptide involved in hypothalamic coordination of the estrous cycle. In order to characterize GPR173, it is vital to determine how Gpr173 is regulated in the hypothalamus. Since the hypothalamus senses compounds from the blood, such as nutrients and chemicals, we examined the effect of palmitate, a saturated fatty acid, and bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine disrupting chemical, on Gpr173 gene expression. Immortalized hypothalamic neurons were treated with palmitate or BPA for 2-24 h and Gpr173 mRNA levels were assessed with RT-qPCR. Palmitate and BPA both reduced Gpr173 mRNA levels, in part through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), p38. Pre-treatment with palmitate for 24 h blocked the PNX-induction of phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) levels. In conclusion, nutrition levels and environmental chemicals may influence reproductive function through modulation of Gpr173 expression, which may prove to be a future therapeutic target in reproductive health.

30719927|t|Heptachlor-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition in HK-2 cells mediated via TGF-beta1/Smad signalling.
30719927|a|This study investigated the effect of heptachlor-induced oxidative stress (OS) on transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1-mediated epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in human renal proximal tubular epithelial (HK-2) cells. Following treatment of HK-2 cells with an increasing concentration of heptachlor (0.01-10 microM) for 24 h, the intracellular reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde level increased, whereas the glutathione-s-hydroxylase (GSH) level declined significantly in a dose-dependent manner. Pretreatment with N-acetyl cysteine attenuates the heptachlor-induced OS. In this study, we have shown that heptachlor-induced OS regulates the mRNA expression of TGF-beta1-mediated Smad signalling genes accompanied by increased nuclear localization of phosphorylated Smad-2 and phosphorylated Smad-3. Furthermore, the m-RNA and protein level of epithelial marker, that is, E-cadherin decreased while the mesenchymal marker, that is, alpha-smooth muscle actin increased in heptachlor exposed HK-2 cells. In conclusion, heptachlor-induced OS might be responsible for the activation of TGF-beta1/Smad signalling which ultimately leads to renal damage by means of EMT.

30726812|t|Benzo[a]pyrene induces pyroptotic and autophagic death through inhibiting PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in HL-7702 human normal liver cells.
30726812|a|Benzo(alpha)pyrene (BaP) possesses a forceful hepatotoxicity, and is ubiquitous in foods and ambient air. Our previous study found that BaP induced pyroptotic and autophagic death in HL-7702 human liver cells; the relevant mechanisms, however, remain unknown. This work was therefore to unravel the effects of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway on pyroptotic and autophagic death triggered by BaP. Cells were treated with or without LY294002 (PI3K/Akt inhibitor) and IGF-1 (PI3K/Akt activator) before BaP exposure, and the results showed that compared with the control, the protein expression of p-Akt was markedly decreased by BaP (p &lt; 0.05). IGF-1 did not subvert this inhibitive effect of BaP, while LY294002 enhanced it. Furthermore, the protein expression of pyroptosis (Cleaved Caspase-1, NO, IL-1beta, IL-18), as well as LDH and the relative electrical conductivity were significantly augmented by BaP. The levels of these indices were increased by LY294002 pretreatment, and decreased by IGF-1. Similarly, LY294002 enhanced BaP-induced increase in the key protein expression of autophagy (Beclin-1 and LC3II), while IGF-1 weakened it. Finally, the phosphorylation of FOXO4 was clearly (p &lt; 0.01) inhibited by BaP, and LY294002 suppressed this inhibitive effect of BaP, while IGF-1 strengthened it. In conclusion, BaP was able to induce pyroptotic and autophagic death via blocking the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in HL-7702 liver cells.

30742662|t|miRNA expression profiles and molecular networks in resting and LPS-activated BV-2 microglia-Effect of cannabinoids.
30742662|a|Mammalian microRNAs (miRNAs) play a critical role in modulating the response of immune cells to stimuli. Cannabinoids are known to exert beneficial actions such as neuroprotection and immunosuppressive activities. However, the underlying mechanisms which contribute to these effects are not fully understood. We previously reported that the psychoactive cannabinoid Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and the non-psychoactive cannabidiol (CBD) differ in their anti-inflammatory signaling pathways. Using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to stimulate BV-2 microglial cells, we examined the role of cannabinoids on the expression of miRNAs. Expression was analyzed by performing deep sequencing, followed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to describe networks and intracellular pathways. miRNA sequencing analysis revealed that 31 miRNAs were differentially modulated by LPS and by cannabinoids treatments. In addition, we found that at the concentration tested, CBD has a greater effect than THC on the expression of most of the studied miRNAs. The results clearly link the effects of both LPS and cannabinoids to inflammatory signaling pathways. LPS upregulated the expression of pro-inflammatory miRNAs associated to Toll-like receptor (TLR) and NF-kappaB signaling, including miR-21, miR-146a and miR-155, whereas CBD inhibited LPS-stimulated expression of miR-146a and miR-155. In addition, CBD upregulated miR-34a, known to be involved in several pathways including Rb/E2f cell cycle and Notch-Dll1 signaling. Our results show that both CBD and THC reduced the LPS-upregulated Notch ligand Dll1 expression. MiR-155 and miR-34a are considered to be redox sensitive miRNAs, which regulate Nrf2-driven gene expression. Accordingly, we found that Nrf2-mediated expression of redox-dependent genes defines a Mox-like phenotype in CBD treated BV-2 cells. In summary, we have identified a specific repertoire of miRNAs that are regulated by cannabinoids, in resting (surveillant) and in LPS-activated microglia. The modulated miRNAs and their target genes are controlled by TLR, Nrf2 and Notch cross-talk signaling and are involved in immune response, cell cycle regulation as well as cellular stress and redox homeostasis.

30742852|t|Protective role of metformin against methamphetamine induced anxiety, depression, cognition impairment and neurodegeneration in rat: The role of CREB/BDNF and Akt/GSK3 signaling pathways.
30742852|a|BACKGROUND: Methamphetamine is a neuro-stimulant with neurodegenerative effects, and ambiguous mechanism of action. Metformin is an antidiabetic agent with neuroprotective properties but not fully understood mechanisms. The present study investigated the molecular basis of metformin neuroprotection against methamphetamine-induced neurodegeneration. BRIEF METHOD: Sixty adult male rats were randomly divided into six groups: group 1 (received normal saline), group 2 (received 10 mg/kg of methamphetamine) and groups 3, 4, 5 and 6 [received methamphetamine (10 mg/kg) plus metformin (50, 75, 100 and 150 mg/kg) respectively]. Elevated Plus Maze (EPM), Open Field Test (OFT), Forced Swim Test (FST), Tail Suspension Test (TST) and Morris Water Maze (MWM) were used to assess the level of anxiety, depression and cognition in experimental animals. Also animals' hippocampus were isolated and oxidative stress and inflammatory parameters and expression of total and phosphorylated forms of cAMP response element binding (CREB), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), protein kinase B (Akt) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) proteins were evaluated by ELISA method. RESULTS: According to the data obtained, methamphetamine caused significant depression, anxiety, motor activity disturbances and cognition impairment in experimental animals. Metformin, in all used doses, decreased methamphetamine induced behavioral disturbances. Also chronic administration of methamphetamine could increase malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor-Alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukine-1 beta (IL-1beta) in rats, while caused reduction of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities. Metformin, especially in high doses, could prevent these malicious effects of methamphetamine. Also Metformin could activate CREB (both forms), BDNF and Akt (both forms) proteins' expression and inhibited GSK3 (both forms) protein expression in methamphetamine treated rats. SIGNIFICANCE: According to obtained data, metformin could protect the brain against methamphetamine-induced neurodegeneration probably by mediation of CREB/BDNF or Akt/GSK3 signaling pathways. These data suggested that CREB/BDNF or Akt/GSK3 signaling pathways may have a critical role in methamphetamine induced neurotoxicity and/or neuroprotective effects of metformin.

30742918|t|Assessment of human estrogen receptor agonistic/antagonistic effects of veterinary drugs used for livestock and farmed fish by OECD in vitro stably transfected transcriptional activation assays.
30742918|a|The presence of veterinary drug residues in foods and the environment could potentially cause adverse effects on humans and wildlife. Several veterinary drugs were reported to exhibit endocrine disrupting effects via binding affinities to sexual hormone receptors such as estrogen and androgen receptors. Therefore, we confirmed the human estrogen receptor (ER) agonistic/antagonistic effects of 135 chemicals that were used as veterinary drugs in Korea by the official Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in vitro ER transcriptional activation (TA) assay using the VM7Luc4E2 cell line. In the case of ER agonist screening, 7 veterinary drugs (cefuroxime, cymiazole, trenbolone, zeranol, phoxim, altrenogest and nandrolone) were determined to be ER agonists. In addition, only zeranol was found to exhibit weak ER antagonistic activity. These 7 veterinary drugs, which were determined as ER agonists and/or antagonists by an OECD in vitro assay, were also found to have binding affinity to ERs. These results indicate that various veterinary drugs possess potential (anti-)estrogenic effects. However, further study is needed to determine the precise endocrine-disrupting effects of these compounds.

30744607|t|Ligustrazin increases lung cell autophagy and ameliorates paraquat-induced pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting PI3K/Akt/mTOR and hedgehog signalling via increasing miR-193a expression.
30744607|a|BACKGROUND: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels largely determine pulmonary fibrosis. Antioxidants have been found to ameliorate lung fibrosis after long-term paraquat (PQ) exposure. The effects of antioxidants, however, on the signalling pathways involved in PQ-induced lung fibrosis have not yet been investigated sufficiently. Here, we examined the impacts of ligustrazin on lung fibrosis, in particular ROS-related autophagy and pro-fibrotic signalling pathways, using a murine model of PQ-induced lung fibrosis. METHODS: We explored the effects of microRNA-193 (miR-193a) on Hedgehog (Hh) and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling and oxidative stress in lung tissues. Levels of miR-193a, protein kinase B (Akt), phosphoinositide 3-Kinase (PI3K), ceclin1, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), sonic hedgehog (SHH), myosin-like Bcl2 interacting protein (LC3), smoothened (Smo), and glioma-associated oncogene-1 (Gli-1) mRNAs were determined with quantitative real-time PCR. Protein levels of PI3K, p-mTOR, p-Akt, SHH, beclin1, gGli-1, LC3, smo, transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), mothers against DPP homologue-2 (Smad2), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), collagen I, collagen III, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) nuclear factor erythroid 2p45-related factor-2 (Nrf2), and p-Smad2 were detected by western blotting. In addition, alpha-SMA, malondialdehyde, ROS, superoxide dismutase (SOD), oxidised and reduced glutathione, hydroxyproline, and overall collagen levels were identified in lung tissues using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Long-term PQ exposure blocked miR-193a expression, reduced PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling, increased oxidative stress, inhibited autophagy, increased Hh signalling, and facilitated the formation of pulmonary fibrosis. Ligustrazin blocked PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Hh signalling as well as reduced oxidative stress via increasing miR-193a expression and autophagy, all of which reduced pulmonary fibrosis. These effects of ligustrazin were accompanied by reduced TGF-beta1, CTGF, and Collagen I and III expression. CONCLUSIONS: Ligustrazin blocked PQ-induced PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Hh signalling by increasing miR-193a expression, thereby attenuating PQ-induced lung fibrosis.

30753810|t|Suppressive effects of pelargonidin on lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory responses.
30753810|a|Pelargonidin (PEL) is a well-known red pigment found in plants, and has been reported as having important biological activities that are potentially beneficial for human health. Here, we tested the possible use of PEL in the treatment of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated vascular inflammatory responses. The anti-inflammatory activities of PEL were determined by measuring permeability, neutrophils adhesion and migration, and activation of pro-inflammatory proteins in LPS-activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and mice. We found that PEL inhibited LPS-induced barrier disruption, expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), and adhesion/transendothelial migration of neutrophils to human endothelial cells. PEL also suppressed LPS-induced hyperpermeability and leukocytes migration in vivo. Furthermore, PEL suppressed the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or Interleukin (IL)-6 and the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) or extracellular regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2 by LPS. Moreover, treatment with PEL resulted in reduced LPS-induced lethal endotoxemia. These results suggest that PEL possesses anti-inflammatory functions by inhibiting hyperpermeability, expression of CAMs, and adhesion and migration of leukocytes, thereby endorsing its usefulness as a therapy for vascular inflammatory diseases.

30760223|t|Genetic analysis of a novel antioxidant multi-target iron chelator, M30 protecting against chemotherapy-induced alopecia in mice.
30760223|a|BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced alopecia has been well documented as a cause of distress to patients undergoing cancer treatment. Almost all traditional chemotherapeutic agents cause severe alopecia. Despite advances in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced alopecia, there is no effective treatment for preventing chemotherapy-induced alopecia. METHODS: In the present study, we investigated the potential role of a multi-target iron chelator, M30 in protecting against cyclophosphamide-induced alopecia in C57BL/6 mice implanted with an osmotic pump. M30 enhanced hair growth and prevented cyclophosphamide-induced abnormal hair in the mice. Furthermore, we examined the gene expression profiles derived from skin biopsy specimens of normal mice, cyclophosphamide-treated mice, and cyclophosphamide treated mice with M30 supplement. RESULTS: The top genes namely Tnfrsf19, Ercc2, Lama5, Ctsl, and Per1 were identified by microarray analysis. These genes were found to be involved in the biological processes of hair cycle, hair cycle phase, hair cycle process, hair follicle development, hair follicle maturation, hair follicle morphogenesis, regulation of hair cycle. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that M30 treatment is a promising therapy for cyclophosphamide-induced alopecia and suggests that the top five genes have unique preventive effects in cyclophosphamide-induced transformation.

30769049|t|Aloin reduces inflammatory gene iNOS via inhibition activity and p-STAT-1 and NF-kappaB.
30769049|a|Aloin is the major anthraquinone glycoside obtained from the Aloe species and exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities. Here, we aimed to determine the effects of aloin on heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) induction and on the expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX) 2 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). To the end, aloin was tested whether aloin reduces iNOS protein expression and inflammatory markers (interleukin (IL)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha) in LPS-treated mice lung tissue. The results indicated that aloin affected HO-1 induction and reduced LPS-activated NF-kappaB-luciferase activity showed to preferential inhibition of iNOS/NO and COX-2/PGE2 that was partly related to inhibition of STAT-1 phosphorylation. In particular, aloin induced translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol into the nucleus by an increased Nrf2-ARE binding activity, and reduced IL-1beta production in LPS-activated HUVECs. The reduced expression of iNOS/NO by aloin was reversed by siHO-1RNA-transfection. In LPS-treated mice, aloin significantly reduced iNOS protein in lung tissues, and TNF-alpha levels in the BALF. We concluded that aloin may be beneficial for treatment of lung injury.

30771440|t|Aloe emodin induces hepatotoxicity by activating NF-kappaB inflammatory pathway and P53 apoptosis pathway in zebrafish.
30771440|a|The aim of this study was to investigate the hepatotoxic effect and its underlying mechanism of aloe emodin (AE). AE was docked with the targets of NF-kappaB inflammatory pathway and P53 apoptosis pathway respectively by using molecular docking technique. To verify the results of molecular docking and further investigate the hepatotoxicity mechanism of AE, the zebrafish Tg (fabp10: EGFP) was used as an animal model in vivo. The pathological sections of zebrafish liver were analyzed to observe the histopathological changes and Sudan black B was used to study whether there were inflammatory reactions in zebrafish liver or not. Then TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) was used to detect the apoptotic signal of zebrafish liver cells, finally the mRNA expression levels as well as the protein expression levels of the targets in NF-kappaB and P53 pathways in zebrafish were measured by quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot. Molecular docking results showed that AE could successfully dock with all the targets of NF-kappaB and P53 pathways, and the docking scores of most of the targets were equal to or higher than that of the corresponding ligands. Pathological sections showed AE could cause zebrafish liver lesions and the result of Sudan black B staining revealed that AE blackened the liver of zebrafish with Sudan black B. Then TUNEL assay showed that a large number of dense apoptotic signals were observed in AE group, mainly distributed in the liver and yolk sac of zebrafish. The results of qRT-PCR and western blot showed that AE increased the mRNA and protein expression levels of pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic targets in NF-kappaB and P53 pathways. AE could activate the NF-kappaB inflammatory pathway and the P53 apoptosis pathway, and its hepatotoxic mechanism was related to activation of NF-kappaB-P53 inflammation-apoptosis pathways.

30776459|t|Prenatal caffeine exposure increases the susceptibility to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in female offspring rats via activation of GR-C/EBPalpha-SIRT1 pathway.
30776459|a|This study aimed to evaluate female adult offspring induced by prenatal caffeine exposure (PCE) are susceptible to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and to explore the underlying programming mechanisms. Pregnant rats were intragastrically administered caffeine (30, 60, and 120 mg/kg.d) on gestational day (GD) 9-20. The female adult offspring were randomly divided into three groups: offspring without or with chronic stress during postnatal week (PW) 10-12 and PW28 offspring. Results showed that PW28 PCE female offspring had a higher hepatic triglyceride content and Kleiner scores, accompanied by elevated serum corticosterone levels. Moreover, the expression levels of hepatic glucocorticoid receptor (GR), CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha), fatty acid synthetase (FASN) and the transcription factor-sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) were increased, but SIRT1 expression was decreased. The fetal rats and PW12 offspring with chronic stress exhibited similar changes as PW28 offspring, accompanied by increased levels of H3K14ac and H3K27ac in the SREBP1c and FASN gene promoters. These effects were also observed by treating L02 cells with cortisol and were partially reversed by GR or C/EBPalpha siRNA or treatment with the SIRT1 agonist resveratrol. Taken together, PCE-induced high glucocorticoids levels enhanced histone modifications and expression of SREBP1c and FASN via activation of the GR-C/EBPalpha-SIRT1 pathway in utero. This enhanced female fetal hepatic triglyceride synthesis and continued throughout postnatal and adult life, increasing the susceptibility to adult NAFLD.

30779732|t|Identification of whole blood mRNA and microRNA biomarkers of tissue damage and immune function resulting from amphetamine exposure or heat stroke in adult male rats.
30779732|a|This work extends the understanding of how toxic exposures to amphetamine (AMPH) adversely affect the immune system and lead to tissue damage. Importantly, it determines which effects of AMPH are and are not due to pronounced hyperthermia. Whole blood messenger RNA (mRNA) and whole blood and serum microRNA (miRNA) transcripts were identified in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats after exposure to toxic AMPH under normothermic conditions, AMPH when it produces pronounced hyperthermia, or environmentally-induced hyperthermia (EIH). mRNA transcripts with large increases in fold-change in treated relative to control rats and very low expression in the control group were a rich source of organ-specific transcripts in blood. When severe hyperthermia was produced by either EIH or AMPH, significant increases in circulating organ-specific transcripts for liver (Alb, Fbg, F2), pancreas (Spink1), bronchi/lungs (F3, Cyp4b1), bone marrow (Np4, RatNP-3b), and kidney (Cesl1, Slc22a8) were observed. Liver damage was suggested also by increased miR-122 levels in the serum. Increases in muscle/heart-enriched transcripts were produced by AMPH even in the absence of hyperthermia. Expression increases in immune-related transcripts, particularly Cd14 and Vcan, indicate that AMPH can activate the innate immune system in the absence of hyperthermia. Most transcripts specific for T-cells decreased 50-70% after AMPH exposure or EIH, with the noted exception of Ccr5 and Chst12. This is probably due to T-cells leaving the circulation and down-regulation of these genes. Transcript changes specific for B-cells or B-lymphoblasts in the AMPH and EIH groups ranged widely from decreasing   40% (Cd19, Cd180) to increasing 30 to 100% (Tk1, Ahsa1) to increasing >=500% (Stip1, Ackr3). The marked increases in Ccr2, Ccr5, Pld1, and Ackr3 produced by either AMPH or EIH observed in vivo provide further insight into the initial immune system alterations that result from methamphetamine and AMPH abuse and could modify risk for HIV and other viral infections.

30793600|t|Impact of CH223191-Induced Mitochondrial Dysfunction on Its Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Agonistic and Antagonistic Activities.
30793600|a|The mechanisms underlying aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) activation by agonists and circumstances that increase the sensitivity toward agonists and AHR inhibition by antagonists are diverse and still not fully understood. AHR antagonist, 2-methyl-2 H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid (2-methyl-4- o-tolylazo-phenyl)-amide, CH223191, has been reported to inhibit the AHR transcription activity. However, CH223191 antagonist activity toward an AHR endogenous ligand, 6-formylindolo[3,2- b]carbazole (FICZ), and its mode of action remain to be elusive. Male BALB/c albino mice, HepG2 cells, and HepG2-XRE-Luc carrying cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1) gene linked to a luciferase reporter were exposed to FICZ alone or in combination with CH223191, buthionine-( S, R)-sulfoximine (BSO), and N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) for 5 h. Microsomal and cellular CYP1A1 enzyme activities, cellular FICZ levels, CYP1A1 reporter activity, mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation were measured. In this study, we showed that AHR activity induced by an AHR endogenous ligand, FICZ, in a dose-dependent manner could be suppressed by CH223191. Indeed, we observed that CH223191 is able to inhibit the catalytic activity of CYP1A1, with an IC50 value of 1.48 muM. Our experiments with silencing RNA sequences showed that ROS formation by mitochondria might take part as a primary event in the downregulation of CYP1A1 by CH223191. We describe a new mechanism for inhibition of AHR-induced CYP1A1 by CH223191. The sensitivity of the AHR to oxidants and its possible reversibility by antioxidants supports the view that CH223191-induced mitochondrial dysfunction might be involved in this pharmacological event.

30794626|t|Stimulated hepatic stellate cell promotes progression of hepatocellular carcinoma due to protein kinase R activation.
30794626|a|Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) were reported to promote the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), however its mechanism is uncertain. We previously reported that protein kinase R (PKR) in hepatocytes regulated HCC proliferation. In this study, we focused on the role of PKR in HSCs, and clarified the mechanism of its association with HCC progression. We confirmed the activation of PKR in a human HSC cell line (LX-2 cell). IL-1beta is produced from HSCs stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or palmitic acid which are likely activators of PKR in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Production was assessed by real-time PCR and ELISA. C16 and small interfering RNA (siRNA) were used to inhibit PKR in HSCs. The HCC cell line (HepG2 cell) was cultured with HSC conditioning medium to assess HCC progression, which was evaluated by proliferation and scratch assays. Expression of PKR was increased and activated in stimulated HSCs, and IL-1beta production was also increased molecular. Key molecules of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway were also upregulated and activated by LPS. Otherwise, PKR inhibition by C16 and PKR siRNA decreased IL-1beta production. HCC progression was promoted by HSC-stimulated conditioning medium although it was reduced by the conditioning medium from PKR-inhibited HSCs. Moreover, palmitic acid also upregulated IL-1beta expression in HSCs, and conditioning medium from palmitic acid-stimulated HSCs promoted HCC proliferation. Stimulated HSCs by activators of PKR in NASH could play a role in promoting HCC progression through the production of IL-1beta, via a mechanism that seems to be dependent on PKR activation.

30796443|t|Mechanistic Interplay Between Autophagy and Apoptotic Signaling in Endosulfan-Induced Dopaminergic Neurotoxicity: Relevance to the Adverse Outcome Pathway in Pesticide Neurotoxicity.
30796443|a|Chronic exposure to pesticides is implicated in the etiopathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Previously, we showed that dieldrin induces dopaminergic neurotoxicity by activating a cascade of apoptotic signaling pathways in experimental models of PD. Here, we systematically investigated endosulfan's effect on the interplay between apoptosis and autophagy in dopaminergic neuronal cell models of PD. Exposing N27 dopaminergic neuronal cells to endosulfan rapidly induced autophagy, indicated by an increased number of autophagosomes and LC3-II accumulation. Prolonged endosulfan exposure (>9 h) triggered apoptotic signaling, including caspase-2 and -3 activation and protein kinase C delta (PKCdelta) proteolytic activation, ultimately leading to cell death, thus demonstrating that autophagy precedes apoptosis during endosulfan neurotoxicity. Furthermore, inhibiting autophagy with wortmannin, a phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor, potentiated endosulfan-induced apoptosis, suggesting that autophagy is an early protective response against endosulfan. Additionally, Beclin-1, a major regulator of autophagy, was cleaved during the initiation of apoptotic cell death, and the cleavage was predominantly mediated by caspase-2. Also, caspase-2 and caspase-3 inhibitors effectively blocked endosulfan-induced apoptotic cell death. CRISPR/Cas9-based stable knockdown of PKCdelta significantly attenuated endosulfan-induced caspase-3 activation, indicating that the kinase serves as a regulatory switch for apoptosis. Additional studies in primary mesencephalic neuronal cultures confirmed endosulfan's effect on autophagy and neuronal degeneration. Collectively, our results demonstrate that a functional interplay between autophagy and apoptosis dictate pesticide-induced neurodegenerative processes in dopaminergic neuronal cells. Our study provides insight into cell death mechanisms in environmentally linked neurodegenerative diseases.

30798811|t|Hepcidin-ferroportin axis in health and disease.
30798811|a|Hepcidin is central to regulation of iron metabolism. Its effect on a cellular level involves binding ferroportin, the main iron export protein, resulting in its internalization and degradation and leading to iron sequestration within ferroportin-expressing cells. Aberrantly increased hepcidin leads to systemic iron deficiency and/or iron restricted erythropoiesis. Furthermore, insufficiently elevated hepcidin occurs in multiple diseases associated with iron overload. Abnormal iron metabolism as a consequence of hepcidin dysregulation is an underlying factor resulting in pathophysiology of multiple diseases and several agents aimed at manipulating this pathway have been designed, with some already in clinical trials. In this chapter, we present an overview of and rationale for exploring the development of hepcidin agonists and antagonists in various clinical scenarios.

30809271|t|Modelling cardiac fibrosis using three-dimensional cardiac microtissues derived from human embryonic stem cells.
30809271|a|Background: Cardiac fibrosis is the most common pathway of many cardiac diseases. To date, there has been no suitable in vitro cardiac fibrosis model that could sufficiently mimic the complex environment of the human heart. Here, a three-dimensional (3D) cardiac sphere platform of contractile cardiac microtissue, composed of human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), is presented to better recapitulate the human heart. Results: We hypothesized that MSCs would develop an in vitro fibrotic reaction in response to treatment with transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), a primary inducer of cardiac fibrosis. The addition of MSCs improved sarcomeric organization, electrophysiological properties, and the expression of cardiac-specific genes, suggesting their physiological relevance in the generation of human cardiac microtissue model in vitro. MSCs could also generate fibroblasts within 3D cardiac microtissues and, subsequently, these fibroblasts were transdifferentiated into myofibroblasts by the exogenous addition of TGF-beta1. Cardiac microtissues displayed fibrotic features such as the deposition of collagen, the presence of numerous apoptotic CMs and the dissolution of mitochondrial networks. Furthermore, treatment with pro-fibrotic substances demonstrated that this model could reproduce key molecular and cellular fibrotic events. Conclusions: This highlights the potential of our 3D cardiac microtissues as a valuable tool for manifesting and evaluating the pro-fibrotic effects of various agents, thereby representing an important step forward towards an in vitro system for the prediction of drug-induced cardiac fibrosis and the study of the pathological changes in human cardiac fibrosis.

30811740|t|Effect of benzo[a]pyrene on the expression of miR-126, miR-190a and their target genes EGFL7, TP53INP1 and PHLPP1 in primary endometrial cells.
30811740|a|The main topic of this study was to investigate the effect of benzo[a]pyrene (BP) on microRNAs and their target genes expression levels in primary cell cultures from normal and malignant endometrial tissue. MicroRNA-126 (miR-126) and miR-190a were most sensitive to BP treatment. The treatment of both cultures with BP was accompanied by a decrease of miR-126 level and an increase of EGFL7 gene expression level. BP-induced upregulation of miR-190a was detected only in normal cells and it was accompanied with decrease of mRNA levels of TP53INP1 and PHLPP1 genes. Taking into account that BP promoted the proliferation of normal cells and amplified apoptosis of cancer cells, it is possible that miR-190a is involved in general cellular response to BP. The findings of this study indicate that miR-190a and its target genes may be involved in the regulation of cell fate under BP treatment.

30820047|t|Genetic meta-analysis of diagnosed Alzheimer's disease identifies new risk loci and implicates Abeta, tau, immunity and lipid processing.
30820047|a|Risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), the most prevalent dementia, is partially driven by genetics. To identify LOAD risk loci, we performed a large genome-wide association meta-analysis of clinically diagnosed LOAD (94,437 individuals). We confirm 20 previous LOAD risk loci and identify five new genome-wide loci (IQCK, ACE, ADAM10, ADAMTS1, and WWOX), two of which (ADAM10, ACE) were identified in a recent genome-wide association (GWAS)-by-familial-proxy of Alzheimer's or dementia. Fine-mapping of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region confirms the neurological and immune-mediated disease haplotype HLA-DR15 as a risk factor for LOAD. Pathway analysis implicates immunity, lipid metabolism, tau binding proteins, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, showing that genetic variants affecting APP and Abeta processing are associated not only with early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease but also with LOAD. Analyses of risk genes and pathways show enrichment for rare variants (P = 1.32 x 10-7), indicating that additional rare variants remain to be identified. We also identify important genetic correlations between LOAD and traits such as family history of dementia and education.

30825423|t|Protective effects of anthocyanins from bilberry extract in rats exposed to nephrotoxic effects of carbon tetrachloride.
30825423|a|This study examined the nephroprotective effects of 15 different anthocyanins from the bilberry extract on the acute kidney injury caused by CCl4. The acute nephrotoxicity in rats was induced 24 h after the treatment with a single dose of CCl4 (3 mL/kg, i.p.).The nephroprotective effects of the anthocyanins were examined in the animals that had been given the bilberry extract in a single dose of 200 mg of anthocyanins/kg daily, 7 days orally, while on the seventh day, 3 h after the last dose of anthocyanins, the animals received a single dose of CCl4 (3 mL/kg, i.p.) and were sacrificed 24 h later. When the nephrotoxicant alone was administered, it resulted in a substantial increase of the pro-oxidative (TBARS, CD, H2O2, XO, and GSSG) and pro-inflammatory markers (TNF-alpha, NO, and MPO), as well as a noticeable reduction of the antioxidant enzymes (CAT, SOD, POD, GPx, GST, GR) and GSH when compared to the results of the control group. Moreover, the application of CCl4 significantly influenced a reduction of the renal function, as well as an increase in the sensitive and specific injury indicators of the kidney epithelial cells (beta2-microglobulin, NGAL, KIM1/TIM1) in the serum and urine of rats. The pretreatment of the animals poisoned with CCl4 with the anthocyanins from the bilberry extract led to a noticeable reduction in the pro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory markers with reduced consumption of the antioxidant defence kidney capacity, compared to the animals exposed to CCl4 alone. Anthocyanins have been protective for the kidney parenchyma, with an apparent absence of the tubular and periglomerular necrosis, severe degenerative changes, inflammatory mononuclear infiltrates and dilatation of proximal and distal tubules, in contrast to the CCl4-intoxicated animals. The nephroprotective effects of anthocyanins can be explained by strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects achieved through the stabilization and neutralization of highly reactive and unstable toxic CCl4 metabolites.

30825513|t|Caffeine programs hepatic SIRT1-related cholesterol synthesis and hypercholesterolemia via A2AR/cAMP/PKA pathway in adult male offspring rats.
30825513|a|Clinical and animal studies have indicated that hypercholesterolemia has intrauterine developmental origin. Our previous studies showed that prenatal caffeine exposure (PCE) increased the serum total cholesterol (TCH) levels in adult offspring rats. This study investigates the intrauterine programming mechanism of PCE male offspring rats susceptible to adult hypercholesterolemia. Pregnant Wistar rats were intragastrically administered caffeine (30, 60, and 120 mg/kg d) from gestational days (GD) 9 to 20. Male offspring were sacrificed under anesthesia at GD20 and postnatal week (PW) 12, and the serum and liver were collected. The effects of caffeine (0-100 muM, 24 h) on the expression of cholesterol synthesis related genes and their epigenetic mechanisms were confirmed in L02 cells. The results showed that PCE induced higher levels of serum TCH, LDL-C and higher ratios of TCH/HDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C. Furthermore, the high levels of histone acetylation (via H3K14ac and H3K27ac) and the expression of genes (Srebf2, Hmgcr, Hmgcs1) were responsible for cholesterol synthesis. The results of PCE offspring in utero and the data in vitro exhibited similar changes, and accompanied by the reduced expression of adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR), cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), sirtuin1 and protein kinase A (PKA). These changes could be reversed by A2AR agonist (CGS-21680), cAMP agonist (forskolin) and sirtuin1 agonist (resveratrol). Therefore, our results confirmed that caffeine could enhance histone acetylation and expression levels of genes responsible for cholesterol synthesis via inhibiting the A2AR/cAMP/PKA pathway and down-regulating sirtuin1, which continued throughout adulthood and elevated hepatic cholesterol synthesis and hypercholesterolemia in the male offspring rats.

30828079|t|Lysine-Specific Demethylase 1 (LSD1/KDM1A) Is a Novel Target Gene of c-Myc.
30828079|a|Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1/KDM1A) is a histone demethylase and specifically catalyzes the demethylation of mono- and di-methylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4). The LSD1-mediated demethylation of H3K4 promotes the assembly of the c-Myc-induced transcription initiation complex. Although LSD1 and c-Myc are both strongly expressed in human cancers, the mechanisms by which their activities are coordinated remain unclear. We herein demonstrated that LSD1 is a direct target gene of c-Myc. The knockdown of c-Myc decreased the expression of LSD1 in several cancer cell lines. We identified two non-canonical E-boxes in the proximal promoter region of the LSD1 gene. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that c-Myc bound to these E-boxes in the LSD1 promoter. Importantly, LSD1 mRNA expression correlated with c-Myc expression in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), glioblastoma, stomach adenocarcinoma, and prostate adenocarcinoma. The present results suggest that LSD1 is induced by c-Myc and forms a positive feedback mechanism in transcription reactions by c-Myc.

30851411|t|Transcriptional profiling of lactic acid treated reconstructed human epidermis reveals pathways underlying stinging and itch.
30851411|a|The incidence of sensitive skin with stinging and itch following chemical exposure in products such as cosmetics is increasing, but molecular mechanisms underlying this pathophysiology remain understudied. Here we performed transcriptional analysis of reconstructed human epidermis (RHE) 1, 6, and 24 h following topical lactic acid (LA) application, a known inducer of the sensitive skin reaction. Since little is known about the specific role of keratinocyte transcriptional changes in mediating stinging and itch, we performed pathway analysis using several publically available databases and then focused on significantly changed transcripts involved in stress responses and itch signaling using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database. LA treatment induced damage-associated genes HSPA1A, DDIT3, IL1A, and HMGB2. Neurotrophic factors including BDNF, ARTN, PGE2, and chemokines were also upregulated. Stimulation of the RHE with 5% LA did not reduce cell viability, but reduced the trans-epidermal electric resistance, suggesting barrier dysfunction. Accordingly, skin barrier formation genes such as filaggrins (FLG, FLG2) and corneodesmosin (CDSN) were downregulated. To our knowledge, this is the first study focusing on transcriptional changes underlying the stinging response of keratinocytes upon LA stimulation. While follow-up research is needed, this study provides new insight into the mechanisms underlying the sensitive skin reaction.

30853489|t|Gallic acid protects against ethanol-induced hepatocyte necroptosis via an NRF2-dependent mechanism.
30853489|a|Alcoholic liver disease (ALD), featured by excessive hepatocyte death and inflammation, is a prevalent disease that causes heavy health burdens worldwide. Hepatocyte necroptosis is a central event that promotes inflammation in ALD. At molecular levels, inhibition of nuclear factor (erythroid - derived 2) - like 2 (NRF2) was an important trigger for cell necroptosis. The protective effects of gallic acid (GA) on liver diseases caused by multiple factors have been elucidated, however, the role of GA in ALD remained unclear. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate the anti-ALD effects of GA and further reveal the molecular mechanisms. Results showed that GA could effectively recover cell viability and reduce the release of aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and lactic dehydrogenase by ethanol-stimulated hepatocytes. More importantly, GA limited hepatocyte necroptosis under ethanol stimulation, which was characterized by reduced expression of distinct necroptotic signals receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) and RIP3 and release of high mobility group box protein 1. Mechanistically, GA could induce NRF2 expression in ethanol-incubated hepatocytes, which was a molecular basis for GA to suppress ethanol-induced hepatocyte necroptosis. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that GA improved ethanol-induced hepatocyte necroptosis in vitro. Further, NRF2 activation might be requisite for GA to exert its protective effects.

30853599|t|Maternal exposure to imazalil disrupts the endocrine system in F1 generation mice.
30853599|a|The fungicide imazalil (IMZ), an AR antagonist, has been linked to endocrine disruption in animals. Here, adult female C57BL/6 mice were administered IMZ through their drinking water at levels of 0, 0.025% and 0.25% during the gestation and lactation periods (the exposed females are marked as F0, and the offspring are marked as F1). Then, we evaluated the physiological, biochemical and gene expression levels in mice after maternal IMZ exposure. The genes involved in sex hormone receptors, cholesterol synthesis and T synthesis were generally inhibited, and the serum total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were also decreased in the F0 generation female mice. In addition, after F0 IMZ exposure, ovarian androgen receptor (AR) expression was significantly inhibited, and the androgen levels in the serum increased significantly. This may lead to the appearance of progressive virilization during pregnancy. This phenomenon leads to an aromatase deficiency in the F1 generation mice, which results in a decrease in androgen conversion into estrogen and androgen accumulation. In addition, the mRNA expression of key genes and the serum TC, HDL-C, and LDL-C levels increased in the F1 generation after maternal exposure to IMZ. In addition, testicular TC and LDL-C levels also decreased in the F1 generation male mice. Molecular docking analysis revealed that key hydrogen bonds were formed by nitrogen atoms of the imidazole bonds with Trp751 of the ARs. Our data suggests that maternal IMZ exposure could induce endocrine disruption in the next generation of mice.

30876885|t|Ochratoxin A upregulates biomarkers associated with hypoxia and transformation in human kidney cells.
30876885|a|Cellular adaptation to hypoxia is controlled by hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha), a transcription factor activated in response to oxygen tension, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammation. Overexpression of HIF1alpha and HSP90 has been associated with cancer induction. Ochratoxin A (OTA), a mycotoxin contaminant of food and beverages, has been linked to renal tumours and progressive nephropathies, inflammation and pro-oxidation. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of OTA on hypoxic and transformative regulators in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. We evaluated the protein expression of HIF1alpha, HSP90 and PDK1 (western blotting), mRNA expression of HIF1alpha, VEGF, EPO and TGFbeta (qPCR), and ATP levels (luminometry) in HEK293 cells exposed to a range of OTA concentrations (0.125 muM-0.5 muM) over two time periods (24 h and 48 h). After 24 h, OTA increased HIF1alpha protein (p &lt; 0.005) and EPO gene expression (p &lt; 0.05), while VEGF and TGFbeta was significantly increased at 48 h. We also observed a correlation between PDK1 expression and ATP levels. In conclusion, OTA disrupts hypoxia regulation, modulates metabolic activity, and alters growth signalling (VEGF, TGFbeta), which may lead to tumourigenesis.

30877704|t|The Protective Effects of Increasing Serum Uric Acid Level on Development of Metabolic Syndrome.
30877704|a|BACKGROUND: It has not been determined whether changes in serum uric acid (SUA) level are associated with incident metabolic syndrome (MetS). The aim of the current study was to investigate the relationship between changes in SUA level and development of MetS in a large number of subjects. METHODS: In total, 13,057 subjects participating in a medical health check-up program without a diagnosis of MetS at baseline were enrolled. Cox proportional hazards models were used to test the independent association of percent changes in SUA level with development of MetS. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, fat-free mass (%), estimated glomerular filtration rate, smoking status, fasting glucose, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and baseline SUA levels, the hazard ratios (HRs) (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for incident MetS in the second, third, and fourth quartiles compared to the first quartile of percent change in SUA level were 1.055 (0.936 to 1.190), 0.927 (0.818 to 1.050), and 0.807 (0.707 to 0.922) in male (P for trend &lt;0.001) and 1.000 (0.843 to 1.186), 0.744 (0.615 to 0.900), and 0.684 (0.557 to 0.840) in female (P for trend &lt;0.001), respectively. As a continuous variable in the fully-adjusted model, each one-standard deviation increase in percent change in SUA level was associated with an HR (95% CI) for incident MetS of 0.944 (0.906 to 0.982) in male (P=0.005) and 0.851 (0.801 to 0.905) in female (P&lt;0.001). CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrated that increasing SUA level independently protected against the development of MetS, suggesting a possible role of SUA as an antioxidant in the pathogenesis of incident MetS.

30878453|t|Naringin regulates bone metabolism in glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head via the Akt/Bad signal cascades.
30878453|a|PURPOSE: Glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (GIONFH) is a common disease following long-term use or large doses of glucocorticoids. The pathogenesis of GIONFH remains controversial, and abnormal bone metabolism caused by glucocorticoids(GCs) may be one of the important factors. Due to its positive effect on bone remodeling, naringin shows potential therapeutic effects in bone metabolism-related diseases. In this study, we hypothesized that naringin regulated bone metabolism in rat GIONFH via the Akt/Bad signal cascades. METHODS: In vitro, a dexamethasone (Dex)- or naringin-treated cell model was used to evaluate the function of naringin. In vivo, methylprednisolone (MPS)-treated rat model was used to evaluate the function of naringin in GIONFH. In vitro, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and Edu staining was used to evaluate the proliferation of osteocytes, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, Annexin V-FITC-PI, and western blotting were used to evaluate the apoptosis of osteocytes. We also verified the effects of naringin on osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis. In vivo, we used micro-CT (computed tomography), histological, and immunohistochemical analysis to evaluate the effect of naringin. Moreover, the mechanism of naringin regulating the bone metabolism through the Akt/Bad pathway was also investigated using bioinformatics analysis and western blotting. RESULTS: The results of in vitro study showed that Akt activated by naringin promoted osteogenesis and osteocyte proliferation; in addition, osteocyte apoptosis and osteoclastogenesis was inhibited by Akt activation and Bad suppression. According to the in vivo study, naringin prevented GIONFH in a rat model as shown by micro-CT scanning and histological and immunohistochemical analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, we concluded that naringin is an effective compound for promoting bone repair and preventing bone loss in rats with GIONFH through Akt/Bad signal cascades.

30879349|t|RX-3117 (fluorocyclopentenyl cytosine): a novel specific antimetabolite for selective cancer treatment.
30879349|a|INTRODUCTION: RX-3117 is an oral, small molecule cytidine analog anticancer agent with an improved pharmacological profile relative to gemcitabine and other nucleoside analogs. The agent has excellent activity against various cancer cell lines and xenografts including gemcitabine-resistant variants and it has excellent oral bioavailability; it is not a substrate for the degradation enzyme cytidine deaminase. RX-3117 is being evaluated at a daily oral schedule of 700 mg (5 days/week for 3 weeks) which results in plasma levels in the micromolar range that have been shown to be cytotoxic to cancer cells. It has shown clinical activity in refractory bladder cancer and pancreatic cancer. Areas covered: The review provides an overview of the relevant market and describes the mechanism of action, main pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic features and clinical development of this investigational small molecule. Expert opinion: RX-3117 is selectively activated by uridine-cytidine kinase 2 (UCK2), which is expressed only in tumors and has a dual mechanism of action: DNA damage and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). Because of its tumor selective activation, novel mechanism of action, excellent oral bioavailability and candidate biomarkers for patient selection, RX-3117 has the potential to replace gemcitabine in the treatment of a spectrum of cancer types.

30880218|t|Stimulation of eryptosis by broad-spectrum insect repellent N,N-Diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET).
30880218|a|N,N-Diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET) is the most widely used insect repellent in the world. Adverse effects following DEET exposure are well documented. Moreover, DEET has been shown to possess cytotoxic and apoptotic properties in nucleated cells. Although red blood cells (RBCs) lack intracellular organelles, they nevertheless undergo programmed cell death termed eryptosis. Compromised RBC health contributes to the development of anemia; a condition affecting 25% of the global population. This study investigated the interaction between DEET and human RBCs, and explored accompanying biochemical and molecular alterations. RBCs at 5% hematocrit were incubated in presence and absence of 1-5 mM (0.02%-0.1%) of DEET for 6 h at 37  C. Hemolysis was spectrophotometrically determined by hemoglobin release, while major eryptotic events were analyzed by flow cytometer. Phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure was detected with Annexin-V-FITC, cell volume by forward scatter (FSC) of light, intracellular calcium with Fluo-3/AM, and reactive oxygen species with 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA). DEET caused slight hemolysis at 4 and 5 mM, and significantly increased Annexin-V-FITC and Fluo3 fluorescence, with reduced FSC at 5 mM. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ abolished DEET-induced Fluo3 fluorescence but had no effect on Annexin-V binding. Importantly, blockade of eryptotic signaling mediators p38 MAPK, caspases, protein kinase C, casein kinase 1, or necroptotic kinases receptor-interacting protein 1 and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein, with small molecule inhibitors, did not ameliorate DEET-mediated PS externalization. In conclusion, DEET elicits suicidal erythrocyte death; an event characterized by loss of membrane asymmetry, cell shrinkage, and elevations in intracellular Ca2+ mainly through dysregulated Ca2+ influx.

30885713|t|Camptothecin induces mitotic arrest through Mad2-Cdc20 complex by activating the JNK-mediated Sp1 pathway.
30885713|a|Camptothecin (CPT) is a popular therapeutic agent that targets topoisomerase I. Our findings demonstrated that CPT-induced microtubule polymerization results in markedly increased histone H3 phosphorylation. CPT also enhanced interactions between the mitotic checkpoint proteins, Mad2 and Cdc20, and thereby increased mitotic arrest. Transient knockdown of Mad2 completely restored cell cycle progression from CPT-induced mitotic arrest, while simultaneously reduced cyclin B1 and Cdk1 expression. Moreover, we found that c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) acts upstream of Sp1, which upregulates p21-mediated mitotic arrest in response to CPT; furthermore, knockdown of p21 restored cell cycle progression, while inhibition of Cdks completely restored cell cycle progression from CPT-induced mitotic arrest. We hypothesized that, during mitotic arrest in response to CPT, cell survival signaling blocks apoptosis, thereby enhancing mitotic arrest. As expected, a caspase-9 inhibitor, z-LEHD-FMK, and an autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenine (3 MA), significantly diminished CPT-induced mitotic arrest. On the other hand, when Mad2 was depleted, z-LEHD-FMK and 3 MA markedly increased apoptosis, and restored cell cycle progression. Taken together, these results suggest that CPT decodes the action of topoisomerase I-mediated tubulin targeting drugs, leading to mitotic arrest by upregulating Mad2 through the JNK-mediated Sp1 pathway and autophagy formation from tubulin polymerization.

30890645|t|Key role of soluble epoxide hydrolase in the neurodevelopmental disorders of offspring after maternal immune activation.
30890645|a|Maternal infection during pregnancy increases risk of neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in offspring. In rodents, maternal immune activation (MIA) yields offspring with schizophrenia- and ASD-like behavioral abnormalities. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) plays a key role in inflammation associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Here we found higher levels of sEH in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of juvenile offspring after MIA. Oxylipin analysis showed decreased levels of epoxy fatty acids in the PFC of juvenile offspring after MIA, supporting increased activity of sEH in the PFC of juvenile offspring. Furthermore, expression of sEH (or EPHX2) mRNA in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurospheres from schizophrenia patients with the 22q11.2 deletion was higher than that of healthy controls. Moreover, the expression of EPHX2 mRNA in postmortem brain samples (Brodmann area 9 and 40) from ASD patients was higher than that of controls. Treatment with 1-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-propionylpiperidin-4-yl)urea (TPPU), a potent sEH inhibitor, in juvenile offspring from prenatal day (P) 28 to P56 could prevent cognitive deficits and loss of parvalbumin (PV) immunoreactivity in the medial PFC of adult offspring after MIA. In addition, dosing of TPPU to pregnant mothers from E5 to P21 could prevent cognitive deficits, and social interaction deficits and PV immunoreactivity in the medial prefrontal cortex of juvenile offspring after MIA. These findings suggest that increased activity of sEH in the PFC plays a key role in the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring after MIA. Therefore, sEH represents a promising prophylactic or therapeutic target for neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring after MIA.

30910249|t|Molecular markers in recurrent stage I, grade 1 endometrioid endometrial cancers.
30910249|a|OBJECTIVES: Stage I, grade 1 endometrial cancers have low recurrence rates and often do not receive adjuvant therapy. We compared recurrent cases to matched non-recurrent controls to evaluate for molecular markers associated with higher risk of recurrence. METHODS: A case-control study including all cases of recurrent stage I, grade 1 endometrioid endometrial cancer at one institution in a ten-year period. Cases were matched to controls by age, BMI, weight and stage. Molecular testing and immunohistochemistry were performed on archival tumor specimens: microsatellite instability (MSI-H), mismatch repair status, POLE mutational status, and next-generation sequencing. RESULTS: 15 stage I, grade 1 endometrial cancer cases with recurrent disease and available tumor specimens were identified. CTNNB1 and MSI-H were present at significantly higher rates in cases than controls (CTNNB1 60% vs. 28%, OR 3.9, 95%CI 1.1-14.7, p = 0.04 and MSI-H 53% vs. 21%, OR 4.4, 95%CI 1.1-17.0, p = 0.03). POLE mutations were found in 0% of cases vs. 7% of controls (p = 0.54). Among specimens demonstrating microsatellite stability (MSS), 100% of cases vs. 26% of controls had CTNNB1 mutations (p &lt; 0.001). CTNNB1 wild type tumors were MSI-H in 100% of cases vs. 19% of controls (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to controls, CTNNB1 mutation is present at significantly higher rates in recurrent stage I, grade 1 endometrial cancers and is found most commonly in MSS tumors. MSI-H is also present at significantly higher rates in recurrent cases. These markers may be useful for prognostic risk stratification and adjuvant therapy decision-making in this otherwise low-risk population.

30918470|t|Ginsenoside Rg1 Regulates SIRT1 to Ameliorate Sepsis-Induced Lung Inflammation and Injury via Inhibiting Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Inflammation.
30918470|a|Objectives: To investigate the protective effect of ginsenoside Rg1 on relieving sepsis-induced lung inflammation and injury in vivo and in vitro. Methods: Cultured human pulmonary epithelial cell line A549 was challenged with LPS to induce cell injury, and CLP mouse model was generated to mimic clinical condition of systemic sepsis. Rg1 was applied to cells or animals at indicated dosage. Apoptosis of cultured cells was quantified by flow cytometry, along with ELISA for inflammatory cytokines in supernatant. For septic mice, lung tissue pathology was examined, plus ELISA assay for serum cytokines. Western blotting was used to examine the activation of inflammatory pathways and ER stress marker proteins in both cells and mouse lung tissues. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was quantified by DCFDA kit. Results: Ginsenoside Rg1 treatment remarkably suppressed apoptosis rate of LPS-induced A549 cells, relieved mouse lung tissue damage, and elevated survival rate. Rg1 treatment also rescued cells from LPS-induced intracellular ROS. In both A549 cells and mouse lung tissues, further study showed that Rg1 perfusion significantly suppressed the secretion of inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) alpha and interleukin- (IL-) 6 and relieved cells from ER stress as supported by decreased expression of marker proteins via upregulating sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). Conclusion: Our results showed that ginsenoside Rg1 treatment effectively relieved sepsis-induced lung injury in vitro and in vivo, mainly via upregulating SIRT1 to relieve ER stress and inflammation. These findings provide new insights for unrevealing potential candidate for severe sepsis accompanied with lung injury.

30926722|t|2019 update of the EULAR recommendations for the management of systemic lupus erythematosus.
30926722|a|Our objective was to update the EULAR recommendations for the management of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), based on emerging new evidence. We performed a systematic literature review (01/2007-12/2017), followed by modified Delphi method, to form questions, elicit expert opinions and reach consensus. Treatment in SLE aims at remission or low disease activity and prevention of flares. Hydroxychloroquine is recommended in all patients with lupus, at a dose not exceeding 5 mg/kg real body weight. During chronic maintenance treatment, glucocorticoids (GC) should be minimised to less than 7.5 mg/day (prednisone equivalent) and, when possible, withdrawn. Appropriate initiation of immunomodulatory agents (methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate) can expedite the tapering/discontinuation of GC. In persistently active or flaring extrarenal disease, add-on belimumab should be considered; rituximab (RTX) may be considered in organ-threatening, refractory disease. Updated specific recommendations are also provided for cutaneous, neuropsychiatric, haematological and renal disease. Patients with SLE should be assessed for their antiphospholipid antibody status, infectious and cardiovascular diseases risk profile and preventative strategies be tailored accordingly. The updated recommendations provide physicians and patients with updated consensus guidance on the management of SLE, combining evidence-base and expert-opinion.

30926972|t|Biallelic expansion of an intronic repeat in RFC1 is a common cause of late-onset ataxia.
30926972|a|Late-onset ataxia is common, often idiopathic, and can result from cerebellar, proprioceptive, or vestibular impairment; when in combination, it is also termed cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). We used non-parametric linkage analysis and genome sequencing to identify a biallelic intronic AAGGG repeat expansion in the replication factor C subunit 1 (RFC1) gene as the cause of familial CANVAS and a frequent cause of late-onset ataxia, particularly if sensory neuronopathy and bilateral vestibular areflexia coexist. The expansion, which occurs in the poly(A) tail of an AluSx3 element and differs in both size and nucleotide sequence from the reference (AAAAG)11 allele, does not affect RFC1 expression in patient peripheral and brain tissue, suggesting no overt loss of function. These data, along with an expansion carrier frequency of 0.7% in Europeans, implies that biallelic AAGGG expansion in RFC1 is a frequent cause of late-onset ataxia.

30929997|t|ATDC contributes to sustaining the growth and invasion of glioma cells through regulating Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.
30929997|a|Accumulating evidence has documented that ataxia-telangiectasia group D complementing gene (ATDC) is aberrantly expressed in various cancers and is associated with cancer development and progression. However, little is known about the role of ATDC in glioma tumorigenesis. In this study, we aimed to explore the biological function and regulatory mechanism of ATDC in glioma. We found that ATDC expression was highly upregulated in glioma cell lines. Knockdown of ATDC significantly inhibited the growth and invasion of glioma cells. In contrast, overexpression of ATDC markedly promoted the growth and invasion of glioma cells. Moreover, our results showed that inhibition of ATDC reduced the expression levels of Dishevelled 2 (Dvl2) and beta-catenin and impeded the activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, whereas overexpression of ATDC showed the opposite effect. Knockdown of Dvl2 significantly blocked the promotion effect of ATDC overexpression on activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. In addition, silencing of beta-catenin partially reversed the oncogenic effect of ATDC overexpression in glioma cells. Taken together, out study reveals an oncogenic role of ATDC that drives the growth and invasion of glioma by modulating the Wnt/Dvl2/beta-catenin signaling pathway, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for treatment of glioma.

30935952|t|The extra virgin olive oil phenolic oleacein is a dual substrate-inhibitor of catechol-O-methyltransferase.
30935952|a|Catechol-containing polyphenols present in coffee and tea, while serving as excellent substrates for catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)-catalyzed O-methylation, can also operate as COMT inhibitors. However, little is known about the relationship between COMT and the characteristic phenolics present in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). We here selected the EVOO dihydroxy-phenol oleacein for a computational study of COMT-driven methylation using classic molecular docking/molecular dynamics simulations and hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanics, which were supported by in vitro activity studies using human COMT. Oleacein could be superimposed onto the catechol-binding site of COMT, maintaining the interactions with the atomic positions involved in methyl transfer from the S-adenosyl-L-methionine cofactor. The transition state structure for the meta-methylation in the O5 position of the oleacein benzenediol moiety was predicted to occur preferentially. Enzyme analysis of the conversion ratio of catechol to O-alkylated guaiacol confirmed the inhibitory effect of oleacein on human COMT, which remained unaltered when tested against the protein version encoded by the functional Val158Met polymorphism of the COMT gene. Our study provides a theoretical determination of how EVOO dihydroxy-phenols can be metabolized via COMT. The ability of oleacein to inhibit COMT adds a new dimension to the physiological and therapeutic utility of EVOO secoiridoids.

30940561|t|Induction of autophagy, apoptosis and aquisition of resistance in response to piceatannol toxicity in MOLT-4 human leukemia cells.
30940561|a|Piceatannol, a polyphenolic compound present in grapes and wine, has been reported to exhibit anticancer properties. Recently, it has been demonstrated to exert antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in various human cancer types. The aim of our study was to investigate whether piceatannol induces autophagy and apoptosis in MOLT-4 human leukemia cells. Our results revealed that piceatannol activated autophagy in MOLT-4 cells, as evidenced by the detection of an increased level of LC3-II protein and a concomitant decrease in p62/SQSTM1 protein level. Moreover, piceatannol induced apoptosis in MOLT-4 cells which was accompanied by phosphatidylserine externalization, caspase-3 activation, disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, PARP1 cleavage, chromatin condensation, and fragmentation of cell nuclei. However, the toxic effects exerted by piceatannol in MOLT4 cells diminished after longer periods of exposure to the compound. Our findings imply that MOLT-4 cells may acquire resistance to piceatannol toxicity, which may result from the induction of efflux transporters such as P-glycoprotein. The present study provides new data showing that the use of piceatannol as a potential chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of leukemia may be associated with the risk of multidrug resistance.

30955975|t|Conventional and genetic evidence on alcohol and vascular disease aetiology: a prospective study of 500 000 men and women in China.
30955975|a|BACKGROUND: Moderate alcohol intake has been associated with reduced cardiovascular risk in many studies, in comparison with abstinence or with heavier drinking. Studies in east Asia can help determine whether these associations are causal, since two common genetic variants greatly affect alcohol drinking patterns. We used these two variants to assess the relationships between cardiovascular risk and genotype-predicted mean alcohol intake in men, contrasting the findings in men with those in women (few of whom drink). METHODS: The prospective China Kadoorie Biobank enrolled 512 715 adults between June 25, 2004, and July 15, 2008, from ten areas of China, recording alcohol use and other characteristics. It followed them for about 10 years (until Jan 1, 2017), monitoring cardiovascular disease (including ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, and myocardial infarction) by linkage with morbidity and mortality registries and electronic hospital records. 161 498 participants were genotyped for two variants that alter alcohol metabolism, ALDH2-rs671 and ADH1B-rs1229984. Adjusted Cox regression was used to obtain the relative risks associating disease incidence with self-reported drinking patterns (conventional epidemiology) or with genotype-predicted mean male alcohol intake (genetic epidemiology-ie, Mendelian randomisation), with stratification by study area to control for variation between areas in disease rates and in genotype-predicted intake. FINDINGS: 33% (69 897/210 205) of men reported drinking alcohol in most weeks, mainly as spirits, compared with only 2% (6245/302 510) of women. Among men, conventional epidemiology showed that self-reported alcohol intake had U-shaped associations with the incidence of ischaemic stroke (n=14 930), intracerebral haemorrhage (n=3496), and acute myocardial infarction (n=2958); men who reported drinking about 100 g of alcohol per week (one to two drinks per day) had lower risks of all three diseases than non-drinkers or heavier drinkers. In contrast, although genotype-predicted mean male alcohol intake varied widely (from 4 to 256 g per week-ie, near zero to about four drinks per day), it did not have any U-shaped associations with risk. For stroke, genotype-predicted mean alcohol intake had a continuously positive log-linear association with risk, which was stronger for intracerebral haemorrhage (relative risk [RR] per 280 g per week 1 58, 95% CI 1 36-1 84, p&lt;0 0001) than for ischaemic stroke (1 27, 1 13-1 43, p=0 0001). For myocardial infarction, however, genotype-predicted mean alcohol intake was not significantly associated with risk (RR per 280 g per week 0 96, 95% CI 0 78-1 18, p=0 69). Usual alcohol intake in current drinkers and genotype-predicted alcohol intake in all men had similarly strong positive associations with systolic blood pressure (each p&lt;0 0001). Among women, few drank and the studied genotypes did not predict high mean alcohol intake and were not positively associated with blood pressure, stroke, or myocardial infarction. INTERPRETATION: Genetic epidemiology shows that the apparently protective effects of moderate alcohol intake against stroke are largely non-causal. Alcohol consumption uniformly increases blood pressure and stroke risk, and appears in this one study to have little net effect on the risk of myocardial infarction.

30958899|t|Abamectin induces apoptosis and autophagy by inhibiting reactive oxygen species-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling in MGC803 cells.
30958899|a|Abamectin (ABA) is one of the most widely used compounds in agriculture and veterinary medicine. However, the cytotoxicity of ABA in human gastric cells is utterly unknown. In this study, ABA suppressed the proliferation of MGC803 cells by arresting the cell cycle at the G0/G1-phase. Moreover, ABA induced mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis by inducing the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, upregulation of Bax/Bcl-2, and activation of caspase-3. ABA significantly improved the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and reduced P62 protein expression in a dose-dependent manner. Through detection of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, we found ABA induced the accumulation of intracellular ROS and then reduced PI3K/AKT signaling activation related to MGC803 cell apoptosis and autophagy. Our results indicate that ABA exerts cytotoxic effects on human MGC803 cells through apoptosis and autophagy by inhibiting ROS-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling. Furthermore, ABA may be a potential risk to human gastric health.

30964885|t|CCAAT-displacement protein/cut homeobox transcription factor (CUX1) represses estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha) in triple-negative breast cancer cells and can be antagonized by muscadine grape skin extract (MSKE).
30964885|a|Triple-Negative Breast Cancers (TNBCs) are the most difficult to treat subtype of breast cancer and are often associated with high nuclear expression of Snail and Cathepsin L (Cat L) protease. We have previously shown that Snail can increase Cat L expression/activity in prostate and breast cancer cells. This study investigated the role of CUX1 (a downstream substrate of Cat L) in TNBC. We showed that Cat L and CUX1 were highly expressed in TNBC patient tissue/cell lines, as compared to ER-positive samples, using cBioportal data and western blot/zymography analyses. Additionally, luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that CUX1 directly bound to estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha) promoter in MDA-MB-468, a representative TNBC cell line, and that CUX1 siRNA could restore ER-alpha transcription and protein expression. Furthermore, Snail and CUX1 expression in various TNBC cell lines was inhibited by muscadine grape skin extract (MSKE, a natural grape product rich in anthocyanins) or Cat L inhibitor (Z-FY-CHO) leading to decreased cell invasion and migration. MSKE decreased cell viability and increased expression of apoptotic markers in MDA-MB-468 cells, with no effect on non-tumorigenic MCF10A cells. MSKE also decreased CUX1 binding to ER-alpha promoter and restored ER-alpha expression in TNBC cells, while both MSKE and CUX1 siRNA restored sensitivity to estradiol and 4-hydoxytamoxifen as shown by increased cell viability. Therefore, CUX1 activated by Snail-Cat L signaling may contribute to TNBC via ER-alpha repression, and may be a viable target for TNBC using natural products such as MSKE that targets cancer and not normal cells.

30965051|t|HO-1 mediates the anti-inflammatory actions of Sulforaphane in monocytes stimulated with a mycoplasmal lipopeptide.
30965051|a|Exposure to Mycoplasma pneumoniae leads to lung inflammation through a host defense pathway. Increasing evidence has indicated that the mycoplasma-derived membrane lipoprotein, or its analogue macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2 (MALP-2), excretes LPS as an immune system-stimulating substance and plays a crucial role in pathological injury during M. pneumoniae infection. It has been established that Sulforaphane confers anti-inflammatory properties. However, the underlying mechanism responsible for the inhibitory actions of Sulforaphane in the context of mycoplasmal pneumoniae are poorly understood. Here, we report that Sulforaphane is an inducer of heme oxygenase (HO)-1, a cytoprotective enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of heme through signaling pathways in human monocytes. Sulforaphane stimulated NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus, and small interfering RNA-mediated knock-down of Nrf2 significantly inhibited Sulforaphane-induced HO-1 expression. Additionally, PI3K/Akt and ROS were also involved in Sulforaphane-induced Nrf2 activation and HO-1 expression, as revealed by the pharmacological inhibitors LY294002 and NAC. Moreover, Sulforaphane treatment inhibited MALP-2-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and pulmonary inflammation in mice, as well as MALP-2-triggered NF-kappaB activation. Furthermore, SnPP, a selective inhibitor of HO-1, reversed the inhibitory actions of Sulforaphane, while a carbon monoxide-releasing molecule, CORM-2, caused a significant decrease in MALP-2-induced cytokine secretion. Collectively, these results suggest that Sulforaphane functions as a suppressor of the MALP-2-induced inflammatory response, not only by inhibiting the expression of cytokines and the induction of HO-1 but also by diminishing NF-kappaB activation in cultured monocytes and the lungs of mice.

30969080|t|Prognostic Impact of WT-1 and Survivin Gene Expression in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patients.
30969080|a|BACKGROUND: Wilms Tumor 1 (WT1) and Survivin genes are important leukemia-associated antigens (LAAs) in AML with potential prognostic impact. METHODS: We investigated WT1 and Survivin expression levels by RT-PCR in 61 AML patients in correlation with clinical characteristics and outcomes. RESULTS: WT1 was overexpressed in 45 patients (73.8%), associated with higher BM blasts (p = 0.017), lower incidence of favorable-prognosis cytogenetics (p = 0.035), and higher incidence of Flt3-ITD mutations (p = 0.026). Survivin was overexpressed in 17 patients (27.9%) with higher mean WBC count (p = 0.049). Patients with overexpression of either gene showed inferior complete remission (CR) rates and survival rates, patients with overexpression of both genes showed higher mean WBCs (p = 0.035) and higher BM blasts (p = 0.029) while the double negative group showed higher incidence of favorable cytogenetic events (p = 0.021), better CR rates and survival rates. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the introduced prognostic impact of WT1 and Survivin genes in AML patients and its potential use in MRD monitoring and immunotherapy.

30969472|t|Assessments of Algal Toxicity and PBT Behaviour of Pesticides with No Eco-toxicological Data: Predictive Ability of QSA/(T)R Models.
30969472|a|In the present study, the effect of eight pesticides with no ecotoxicological data on the growth rate of Chlorella vulgaris was measured. The selected pesticides are acetochlor, acetamiprid, boscalid diphenamid, gibberellic acid, ioxynil, diclofop and 2,4,5-T. The algal toxicity (IC50 ) of boscalid could not be determined within its solubility limit. Acetamiprid, diphenamid and gibberellic acid revealed IC50 values&gt;100 mg/L. Among the others, the order of 96-h IC50 of pesticides was found as acetochlor&gt;ioxynil&gt;diclofop&gt;2,4,5-T. The IC50 values were also predicted by using four Quantitative Structure-Activity/(Toxicity) Relationship (QSA/(T)R) models selected from the literature. The predictions of the models provided by QSARINS-Chem module of QSARINS as well as those obtained in our previous studies were compared with the results of experimental algal toxicity tests that were performed in our laboratory. The QSTR model generated for the toxicity of diverse chemicals to freshwater algae was able to correctly predict the toxicity order of the pesticides tested in the present study, confirming the utility of the QSA/(T)R approach. Additionally, Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity (PBT) Index model provided via the software QSARINS was employed and boscalid and diclofop were found to be PBT chemicals based on the PBT model. The present study will be very helpful when a more holistic approach applied to understand the fate of these chemicals in the environment.

30974164|t|Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells could reduce the toxic effects of hexavalent chromium on the liver by decreasing endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis via SIRT1/HIF-1alpha signaling pathway in rats.
30974164|a|This study focused on the effect of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) on the repair of rat liver injury induced by Cr (VI). Twenty-four Wistar rats were randomly divided into the control, model and cell therapy group, with 8 rats in each group. Potassium dichromate solution containing 0, 0.4 and 0.4 mg/kg bw Cr (VI) was administered 5 times a week for 30 days. At the end of treatment, rats in the cell therapy group were administered 1 x 107 BMSCs. Two weeks later, serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferase levels in the cell therapy group were significantly improved compared with those in the model group, CM-Dil-labeled BMSCs were localized in rat livers. Compared with the model group, in the cell therapy group the number of apoptotic hepatocytes by TUNEL assay, MDA content, the expression of HIF-1alpha, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated apoptosis-related proteins including Grp78, CHOP, Cleaved-Caspase-12, ATF6, and Bax was significantly lower, and SOD activity, the expression of SIRT1 and Bcl-2 was significantly higher. It is suggested that BMSCs are localized in livers and reduce the toxic effects of Cr (VI) on the liver, and the possible mechanism may be related to the mechanisms of BMSCs decreasing ER stress-mediated hepatocyte apoptosis via the SIRT1/HIF-1alpha signaling pathway.

30981734|t|Endovascular trophoblast expresses CD59 to evade complement-dependent cytotoxicity.
30981734|a|In the human placenta, extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) invade maternal decidual tissues (interstitial trophoblasts) and maternal spiral arteries (endovascular trophoblasts). Although endovascular trophoblasts are directly exposed to maternal blood containing complement components, they are not eliminated by complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). In this study, we investigated the expression and possible function of CD59, one of the membrane-bound complement regulators, in EVTs. Immunohistochemistry of early embryo implantation sites revealed that CD59 was hardly expressed on interstitial trophoblasts, whereas it was intensely expressed on endovascular trophoblasts. Using the human EVT-like cell line Swan71, we established CD59-silencing Swan71 cells (Sw_CD59sh) and non-silencing control Swan71 cells (Sw_CTRsh). In vitro cell apoptosis assay showed that Sw_CD59sh cells were significantly more susceptible to CDC as compared to Sw_CTRsh. Our results suggest that CD59 confers some protection against maternal complement attack to the endovascular trophoblasts.

30983163|t|Licochalcone A induces apoptotic cell death via JNK/p38 activation in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells.
30983163|a|Licochalcone A is widely studied in different fields and possesses antiasthmatic, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and anticancer properties. Its antimalignancy activity on renal, liver, lung, and oral cancer has been explored. However, limited studies have been conducted on the inhibitory effects of licochalcone A in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. We determined cell viability using MTT assay. Cell cycle distribution and apoptotic cell death were measured via flow cytometry. Caspase activation and mitogen-activated protein kinase-related proteins in nasopharyngeal cancer cells in response to licochalcone A were identified by Western blot analysis. Results indicated that licochalcone A reduces cell viability and induces apoptosis, as evidenced by the upregulation of caspase-8 and caspase-9, caspase-3 activation, and cleaved-poly ADP-ribose polymerase expression. Treatment with licochalcone A significantly increases ERK1/2, p38, and JNK1/2 activation. Co-administration of a JNK inhibitor (JNK-IN-8) or p38 inhibitor (SB203580) abolishes the activation of caspase-9, caspase-8, and caspase-3 protein expression during licochalcone A treatment. These findings indicate that licochalcone A exerts a cytostatic effect through apoptosis by targeting the JNK/p38 pathway in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. Therefore, licochalcone A is a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of human nasopharyngeal cancer cells.

30983999|t|Antisense Oligonucleotide: Basic Concepts and Therapeutic Application in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
30983999|a|Several molecular technologies aimed at regulating gene expression that have been recently developed as a strategy to combat inflammatory and neoplastic diseases. Among these, antisense technology is a specific, rapid, and potentially high-throughput approach for inhibiting gene expression through recognition of cellular RNAs. Advances in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive tissue damage in different inflammatory diseases, including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), the two major inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) in humans, have facilitated the identification of novel druggable targets and offered interesting therapeutic perspectives for the treatment of patients. This short review provides a comprehensive understanding of the basic concepts underlying the mechanism of action of the oligonucleotide therapeutics, and summarizes the available pre-clinical and clinical data for oligonucleotide-based therapy in IBD.

30995513|t|Anti-diabetic activity of PUFAs-rich extracts of Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Spirulina platensis in rats.
30995513|a|The contributions to hypoglycemic function and gut microbiota regulation by water and ethanol extracts of the microalgae Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Spirulina platensis were determined. An ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis indicated that most of the compounds in the 55% ethanol extracts of C. pyrenoidosa (CP55) and S. platensis (SP55) were polyunsaturated fatty acids. After an 8-week high-fat high-sucrose diet with C. pyrenoidosa and S. platensis supplementation, glucose tolerance was improved, and the composition of the gut microbiota was altered. The diversity of the gut bacterial community was evaluated using 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. C. pyrenoidosa supplementation increased the abundance of Ruminococcus, Parasutterella, and Erysipelotrichacea and decreased the abundance of Lactobacillus, Turicibacter, and Blautia; S. platensis supplementation increased the abundance of Oscillibacter, Parasutterella, and Alloprevotella and decreased the abundance of Turicibacter. Moreover, Erysipelotrichacea and Ruminococcus were uniquely increased in C. pyrenoidosa treatment groups. Thus, CP55 and SP55 may be developed as effective natural food materials for preventing diabetes, and Ruminococcus may play a vital role in the treatment of diabetes.

31004595|t|Pro-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects of araloside A on human rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes.
31004595|a|Rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes play an essential role in the occurrence and progression of rheumatoid arthritis. As the main pharmacologically active components of Aralia taibaiensis, total saponins, particularly triterpenoid saponins, have been shown to possess multiple pharmacological activities including relieving rheumatism. However, the effect of araloside A, a triterpenoid saponin extracted from the root bark of Aralia taibaiensis, on rheumatoid arthritis remains unknown. Cell counting kit-8 assay was employed to determine cell viability. Flow cytometry analysis, caspase-3/7 activity assay and Western blot analysis of cytochrome c and B-cell lymphoma 2 were conducted to evaluate cell apoptosis. Inflammation was assessed by detecting the production of inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 and interleukin-8, as well as inflammatory mediators including nitric oxide and prostaglandin E2. The changes of the nuclear factor kappa B pathway were examined by Western blot. Results showed that araloside A concentration-dependently inhibited the proliferation of MH7A cells. Meanwhile, araloside A dose-dependently augmented the apoptotic rate and caspase-3/7 activity, increased cytochrome c level and decreased B-cell lymphoma 2 level in MH7A cells. Araloside A concentration-dependently curbed the production of interleukin-6, interleukin-8, prostaglandin E2 and nitric oxide in MH7A cells. In addition, we found that araloside A inhibited the nuclear factor kappa B pathway and inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa B pathway by BAY11-7082 and PDTC showed a similar role to araloside A in MH7A cells. Taken together, araloside A exerted pro-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects in rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes via inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa B pathway.

31009676|t|Fibroblast growth factor 21 secretion enhances glucose uptake in mono(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate-treated adipocytes.
31009676|a|Previous studies revealed that cellular accumulation of mono(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (MEHP) disturbed energy metabolism in adipocytes, where glucose uptake was significantly increased. The present study aimed to determine the mechanisms underlying the increased glucose uptake. MEHP-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes exhibited a significantly increased glucose uptake activity. Immunoblot analysis suggested that the insulin-induced signals were not responsible for the increased glucose uptake. qPCR analysis revealed that both Glut1 and Glut4 genes were highly expressed during adipogenesis; Glut1 mRNA levels in MEHP-treated adipocytes were significantly increased. Moreover, MEHP-treated adipocytes exhibited significantly increased levels of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) in both mRNA and secreted protein. FGF21 is a peptide hormone with pleiotropic effects on regulation of insulin sensitivity and glucose/lipid homeostasis. We found that MEHP, FGF21, and lactate in culture medium together enhanced Fgf21 gene expression in MEHP-treated adipocytes. FGF21 signaling requires fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) and betaKlotho. Fgfr family and betaKlotho genes were actively expressed during adipogenesis; mRNA levels of Fgfr3 and Fgfr4 genes in MEHP-treated adipocytes were significantly increased. Roles of FGF21/FGFR and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signal axes in regulation of glucose uptake were determined. We demonstrated that FGF21/FGFR signals played the major roles in up-regulation of the basal glucose uptake in MEHP-treated adipocytes. The in vitro evidence suggests that cellular FGF21 secretion enhances the basal glucose uptake in MEHP-treated adipocytes.

31016362|t|Ablation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor promotes angiotensin II-induced cardiac fibrosis through enhanced c-Jun/HIF-1alpha signaling.
31016362|a|Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a transcription factor that binds to DNA as a heterodimer with the AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT) after interaction with ligands, such as polycyclic and halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons and other xenobiotics. The endogenous ligands and functions of AHR have been the subject of many investigations. In the present study, the potential role of AHR signaling in the development of left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis by angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion was investigated in mice lacking the AHR gene (Ahr-/-). We also assessed the hypothesis that fenofibrate, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha) activator, reduces cardiac fibrosis through the c-Jun signaling. Male Ahr-/- and age-matched wild-type mice (n = 8 per group) were infused with Ang II at 100 ng/kg/min daily for 2 weeks. Treatment with Ang II increased systolic blood pressure to comparable levels in Ahr-/- and wild-type mice. However, Ahr-/- mice developed severe cardiac fibrosis after Ang II infusion compared with wild-type mice. Ang II infusion also significantly increased the expression of endothelin in the left ventricles of Ahr-/- mice, but not in wild-type mice, and significantly increased the c-Jun signaling in Ahr-/- mice. Ang II infusion also significantly enhanced the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and the downstream target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the left ventricles of Ahr-/- mice. These results suggested pathogenic roles for the AHR signaling pathway in the development of cardiac fibrosis. Treatment with fenofibrate reduced cardiac fibrosis and abrogated the effects of Ang II on the expression of endothelin, HIF-1alpha, and VEGF. The inhibitory effect of fenofibrate on cardiac fibrosis was mediated by suppression of VEGF expression through modulation of c-Jun/HIF-1alpha signaling.

31023080|t|AHU377+Valsartan (LCZ696) Modulates Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) in the Cardiac of Female Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats Compared With Valsartan.
31023080|a|BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a major cause of death and morbidity worldwide and is increasing in prevalence. The Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is the most common mechanism involved in the pathophysiology of hypertension. Understanding the mechanism of the pathophysiologic processes will help direct potential therapeutic strategies to treat hypertension and improve cardiac function. Recently, a novel drug LCZ696 containing both an angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan and a neprilysin inhibitor (AHU377) has shown a promising effect on the treatment of hypertension. However, the effects of LCZ696 on the expression of main components of RAS, namely, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1 R), angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2 R), and angiotensin (1-7) receptor/Mas receptor (MasR) remain unclear. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of LCZ696 on the protective arms of RAS in the cardiac tissue when compared with valsartan under the equal inhibition of AT1 R. We hypothesized that the superior effects of LCZ696 may contribute to its greater effect on the RAS than valsartan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen-week-old female spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were used in this study. Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were used as controls. All rats were randomly divided into LCZ696 (n = 10), valsartan (n = 10), SHR (n = 10), and WKY (n = 10) groups under a 12-hour dark and 12-hour light cycle and provided with regular chow diet and water. The tail-cuff method was performed to measure blood pressure. Cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography. RESULTS: The blood pressure value was lower in LCZ696 than valsartan in SHR after 12 weeks of treatment. Further, LCZ696 inhibits the ACE and AT1 R protein expression in the cardiac of SHR and significantly upregulate the protective axis of RAS components, including ACE2, MasR, and AT2 R. Left ventricular AT2 R messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was higher in the LCZ696+SHR group compared with valsartan. In addition, real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that LCZ696 enhanced the mRNA expression of antihypertensive components AT2 R, ACE2, and MasR and decreased the expression of AT1 R. However, only AT2 R and ACE2 mRNA expressions have a statistical difference between the LCZ696 and valsartan groups. No difference was observed in the mRNA expression of ACE and MasR. The stronger positive signal of transforming growth factor beta in the left ventricle was inhibited in each administrated group compared with SHR groups. CONCLUSIONS: LCZ696 ameliorates the vasoconstrictor axis of the RAS AT1 R and stimulate the protective arm effectors, ACE2 and AT2 R, as well as reverses the compensatory upregulation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase and endothelial nitric oxide synthase in SHR. These findings suggest the mechanistic insight of the cardiac-protective and greater hypotensive effects of LCZ696.

31026535|t|Identifying sex differences arising from polychlorinated biphenyl exposures in toxicant-associated liver disease.
31026535|a|Exposures to persistent environmental pollutants like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) has been associated with liver diseases such as toxicant-associated steatohepatitis (TASH). However, previously published PCB hepatotoxicity studies evaluated mostly male animal models. Moreover, epidemiologic studies on PCB-exposed cohorts evaluating sex differences are scarce. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine hepato-toxicological responses of PCB exposures in the context of sex-dependent outcomes. Male and female C57Bl/6 mice were exposed to Aroclor 1260 (20 mg/kg), and PCB126 (20 mug/kg), by gavage for two weeks. Female mice appeared to be more sensitive to PCB-induced hepatotoxic effects as manifested by increased liver injury markers, namely, hepatic Serpine1 expression. Additionally, compared to their male counterparts, PCB-exposed females exhibited dysregulated hepatic gene expression favoring lipid accumulation rather than lipid breakdown; accompanied by dyslipidemia. Sex differences were also observed in the expression and activation of PCB targets such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) while PCB-induced pancreatic toxicity was similar in both sexes. Importantly, PCB exposure appeared to cause pro-androgenic, anti-estrogenic along with sex-dependent thyroid hormone effects. The overall findings demonstrated that the observed PCB-mediated hepatotoxicity was sex-dependent; confirming the existence of sex differences in environmental exposure-induced markers of TASH and warrants further investigation.

31029725|t|Protective effects of extract of Cleistocalyx operculatus flower buds and its isolated major constituent against LPS-induced endotoxic shock by activating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.
31029725|a|The flower buds of Cleistocalyx operculatus are used as an important ingredient in herbal tea and herbal products in several tropical countries. However, their protective effects and underlying mechanisms on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxic shock remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of ethanol extract of C. operculatus flower buds (ECO) and its major constituent 2',4'-dihydroxy-6'-methoxy-3',5'-dimethylchalcone (DMC) in macrophages and in an experimental LPS-induced sepsis mouse model. ECO inhibited the LPS-induced production and expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in macrophages. In an endotoxic shock mouse model, the oral administration of ECO rescued LPS-induced mortality, and attenuated LPS-induced increases in the serum levels of pro-inflammatory mediators, and damage of the lung and liver tissues. ECO increased the nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), as well as the expression of Nrf2 target genes, including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), in macrophages. Similar to the effects of ECO, DMC also inhibited the LPS-induced inflammatory response in macrophages and endotoxic shock in mice, and activated the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. In conclusion, our findings suggested that ECO and its major constituent, DMC, attenuated LPS-induced endotoxic shock by activating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.

31036733|t|Hypereosinophilia and severe bone disease in an African child: an unexpected diagnosis.
31036733|a|Hypereosinophilic syndromes are rare in children. Sporadic, mild-severity FIP1L1-platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRalpha) rearrangement cases have been reported, mainly in boys. We present the case of a 5-year-old girl referred from her African country of birth, due to severe constitutional symptoms, multifocal bone pain, headache, gastrointestinal complaints, cardiomyopathy and unexplained hypereosinophilia. She presented multiple end-organ diseases and striking bone involvement. Although she had a positive serology for Strongyloides stercoralis, extensive evaluation detected a FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene. Systemic corticosteroids and low-dose imatinib were started and the child became asymptomatic. After 9 months of treatment, FIP1L1-PDGFRA was no longer detected.

31039496|t|Naringenin ameliorates insulin resistance by modulating endoplasmic reticulum stress in hepatitis C virus-infected liver.
31039496|a|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection may lead to hepatic insulin resistance (IR), and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been found to induce IR. In our previous study, naringenin (NGEN) had an insulin sensitization effect on the HCV core protein (HCVCP) infected mouse livers. In the present study, we examined the effects of NGEN on HCVCP infection-induced ER stress and investigated the insulin sensitization mechanism involved. We found that XBP1s was up-regulated in the livers of HCV-infected patients, in hepatocytes with HCV infection, and in HCVCP-infected mice. HCVCP induces ER stress in the mouse liver and hepatocytes by increasing XBP1s and downstream gene expression. Pre-treatment with NGEN inhibited the ER stress and downstream gene expression both in vivo and in vitro. Similar to the HCVCP infection results, NGEN also inhibited the ER stress in tunicamycin-treated Huh-7.5.1 cells. In addition, the role of IRE1alpha in HCVCP-induced IR was detected, and knockdown of IRE1alpha abolished HCVCP-stimulated IR. Overexpression induced IR but could be abolished by NGEN. NGEN also blocked the HCVCP-induced IRE1alpha expression levels that were up-regulated in vivo. Our data reveal that ER stress may be associated with HCV-induced IR, and NGEN treatment inhibited ER stress activity and increased insulin sensitivity by decreasing the expression of IRE1alpha.

31043753|t|A transcriptome-wide association study of high-grade serous epithelial ovarian cancer identifies new susceptibility genes and splice variants.
31043753|a|We sought to identify susceptibility genes for high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) by performing a transcriptome-wide association study of gene expression and splice junction usage in HGSOC-relevant tissue types (N = 2,169) and the largest genome-wide association study available for HGSOC (N = 13,037 cases and 40,941 controls). We identified 25 transcriptome-wide association study significant genes, 7 at the junction level only, including LRRC46 at 19q21.32, (P = 1 x 10-9), CHMP4C at 8q21 (P = 2 x 10-11) and a PRC1 junction at 15q26 (P = 7 x 10-9). In vitro assays for CHMP4C showed that the associated variant induces allele-specific exon inclusion (P = 0.0024). Functional screens in HGSOC cell lines found evidence of essentiality for three of the new genes we identified: HAUS6, KANSL1 and PRC1, with the latter comparable to MYC. Our study implicates at least one target gene for 6 out of 13 distinct genome-wide association study regions, identifying 23 new candidate susceptibility genes for HGSOC.

31044527|t|Fisetin activates Hippo pathway and JNK/ERK/AP-1 signaling to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of human osteosarcoma cells via ZAK overexpression.
31044527|a|Osteosarcoma (OS) is a tumor entity that can cause a large number of cancer-related deaths. Although chemotherapy can decrease proliferation and increase apoptosis of human OS cells, the clinical prognosis remains poor. Fisetin is a flavonol found in fruits and vegetables and is reported to inhibit cell growth in numerous cancers. But the molecular mechanism underlying fisetin in human OS cells is not clear. It is known that sterile-alpha motif and leucine zipper containing kinase (ZAK), a kinase in the MAP3K family, is involved in various cell processes, including proliferation and apoptosis. In our lab, we have demonstrated that overexpression of ZAK can induce apoptosis in human OS cells. In the previous studies, MAP4K, the upstream of MAP3K, can act in parallel to MST1/2 to activate LATS1/2 in the Hippo pathway. Turning on the Hippo pathway can decrease proliferation and otherwise cause cell apoptosis in cancer cells. In this study, we found that fisetin can upregulate ZAK expression to induce the Hippo pathway and mediate the activation of JNK/ERK, the downstream of ZAK, to trigger cell apoptosis via AP-1 dependent manner in human OS cells. These findings reveal a novel molecular mechanism underlying fisetin effect on human OS cells.

31053639|t|An ANGPTL4-ceramide-protein kinase Czeta axis mediates chronic glucocorticoid exposure-induced hepatic steatosis and hypertriglyceridemia in mice.
31053639|a|Chronic or excess glucocorticoid exposure causes lipid disorders such as hypertriglyceridemia and hepatic steatosis. Angptl4 (angiopoietin-like 4), a primary target gene of the glucocorticoid receptor in hepatocytes and adipocytes, is required for hypertriglyceridemia and hepatic steatosis induced by the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone. Angptl4 has also been shown to be required for dexamethasone-induced hepatic ceramide production. Here, we further examined the role of ceramide-mediated signaling in hepatic dyslipidemia caused by chronic glucocorticoid exposure. Using a stable isotope-labeling technique, we found that dexamethasone treatment induced the rate of hepatic de novo lipogenesis and triglyceride synthesis. These dexamethasone responses were compromised in Angptl4-null mice (Angptl4-/-). Treating mice with myriocin, an inhibitor of the rate-controlling enzyme of de novo ceramide synthesis, serine palmitoyltransferase long-chain base subunit 1 (SPTLC1)/SPTLC2, decreased dexamethasone-induced plasma and liver triglyceride levels in WT but not Angptl4-/- mice. We noted similar results in mice infected with adeno-associated virus-expressing small hairpin RNAs targeting Sptlc2. Protein phosphatase 2 phosphatase activator (PP2A) and protein kinase Czeta (PKCzeta) are two known downstream effectors of ceramides. We found here that mice treated with an inhibitor of PKCzeta, 2-acetyl-1,3-cyclopentanedione (ACPD), had lower levels of dexamethasone-induced triglyceride accumulation in plasma and liver. However, small hairpin RNA-mediated targeting of the catalytic PP2A subunit (Ppp2ca) had no effect on dexamethasone responses on plasma and liver triglyceride levels. Overall, our results indicate that chronic dexamethasone treatment induces an ANGPTL4-ceramide-PKCzeta axis that activates hepatic de novo lipogenesis and triglyceride synthesis, resulting in lipid disorders.

31054283|t|Neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitors - thiorphan, sialorphin, and its derivatives exert anti-proliferative activity towards colorectal cancer cells in vitro.
31054283|a|Neutral endopeptidase (NEP) is an enzyme implicated in development of different tumors, e.g. colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, the anti-cancer effects of NEP inhibitors, thiorphan (synthetic compound) and sialorphin (naturally occurring pentapeptide) on CRC cells were investigated. Moreover, we synthesized some derivatives of sialorphin (alanine scan analogues: AHNPR, QANPR, QHAPR, QHNAR; N-acetylated sialorphin; C-amidated sialorphin, and C-amidated alanine scan analogues) to examine the biological activity of these inhibitors on CRC cells. The cytotoxic activity of the NEP inhibitors against CRC cell lines (SW620 and LS180) and normal human fibroblasts (HSF) was evaluated. Additionally, the influence of NEP inhibitors on proliferation, cell cycle progression, induction of apoptosis, and the level of phosphorylation of MAP kinases and mTORC1 signaling pathway proteins in CRC cells were examined. The NEP inhibitors were non-cytotoxic to HSF cells; however, most of them slightly decreased the viability and inhibited proliferation of CRC cells. The N-acetylation or C-amidation of sialorphin or its alanine scan analogues resulted in decreased or abolished anti-proliferative activity of the NEP inhibitors towards the CRC cells. Additionally, thiorphan and sialorphin enhanced the anti-proliferative activity of other CRC-cell growth inhibitors (atrial natriuretic peptide-ANP and melphalan-MEL). The mechanisms involved in the anti-proliferative effects of the tested inhibitors were mediated via NEP and associated with induction of cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase, increased activity of ERK1/2, and a reduced level of phosphorylation of mTOR (Ser2448), 4E-BP1, and p70S6K. However, the NEP inhibitors did not induce apoptosis in the CRC cells. These results have indicated that thiorphan and sialorphin or its derivatives AHNPR, QANPR, QHAPR, and QHNAR have the potential to be used as agents in treatment of patients with CRC.

31054322|t|Delta9-Tetrahydrocannabinol leads to endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in human BeWo trophoblasts.
31054322|a|While studies have demonstrated that the main psychoactive component of cannabis, Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta9-THC) alone induces placental insufficiency and fetal growth restriction, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Given that both (i) endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in pregnancy and (ii) gestational exposure to Delta9-THC leads to placental deficiency, we hypothesized that Delta9-THC may directly induce placental ER stress, influencing trophoblast gene expression and mitochondrial function. BeWo human trophoblast cells treated with Delta9-THC (3-30 muM) led to a dose-dependent increase in all ER stress markers and CHOP; these effects could be blocked with CB1R/CB2R antagonists. Moreover, expression of ER stress-sensitive genes ERRgamma, VEGFA, and FLT-1 were increased by Delta9-THC, and abrogated with the ER stress inhibitor TUDCA. Delta9-THC also diminished mitochondrial respiration and ATP-coupling due to decreased abundance of mitochondrial chain complex proteins. Collectively, these findings indicate that Delta9-THC can directly augment ER stress resulting in aberrant placental gene expression and impaired mitochondrial function.

31077331|t|Acetaminophen Responsive miR-19b Modulates SIRT1/Nrf2 Signaling Pathway in Drug-Induced Hepatotoxicity.
31077331|a|Previous studies suggest that activation of SIRT1 protects liver from acetaminophen (APAP)-induced injury; however, the detailed mechanism of SIRT1 modulation in this process is still incomplete. Therefore, this study was to investigate the pathophysiological role of SIRT1 in APAP-mediated hepatotoxicity. We found that SIRT1 mRNA and protein were markedly upregulated in human LO2 cells and mouse liver upon APAP exposure. In vitro, the specific knockdown of SIRT1 expression ultimately aggravated APAP-evoked cellular antioxidant defense in LO2 cells. Moreover, lentivirus-mediated knockdown of hepatic SIRT1 expression exacerbated APAP-induced oxidative stress and liver injury, especially reduction of Nrf2 and subsequent downregulation of several antioxidant genes. Intriguingly, 30 mg/kg SRT1720, the specific SIRT1 activator, which greatly enhanced Nrf2 expression and antioxidant defense, and then eventually reversed APAP-induced hepatic liver injury in mice. Furthermore, APAP responsive miR-19b played an important role in regulating SIRT1 expression, whereas overexpression miR-19b largely abolished the induction of SIRT1 by APAP in vitro and in vivo. Specific SIRT1 3'-UTR mutation, which disrupted the interaction of miRNA-3'UTR, and successfully abrogated the modulation by miR-19b. Notably, hepatic miR-19b overexpression worsened the APAP-induced hepatotoxicity. In general, our results support the notion that the strong elevation of SIRT1 by APAP responsive miR-19b may represent a compensatory mechanism to protect liver against the drug-induced damage, at least in part by enhancing Nrf2-mediated antioxidant capacity in the liver.

31077745|t|Prodigiosin induces apoptosis and inhibits autophagy via the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway in K562 cells.
31077745|a|Prodigiosin contains a tripyrrole skeleton and shows impressive anticancer potential in multiple cell lines. Numerous studies have been conducted on prodigiosin-induced apoptosis and the related mechanisms. However, few reports have considered the effects of prodigiosin on autophagy and the relationship between apoptosis and autophagy. Here, we examined whether prodigiosin affected apoptosis and autophagy through the extracellular signal-regulated (ERK) signaling pathway in K562 cells, employing cell proliferation, flow cytometry, caspase activity, and western blot analyses. Inhibition of the ERK signaling pathway with PD184352 was conducted to verify the role of this pathway on prodigiosin-mediated processes. Our findings revealed that prodigiosin inhibited the proliferation of K562 cells, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), induced apoptosis and inhibited autophagy in K562 cells. Additionally, the ROS scavenger, N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), partially prevented prodigiosin-induced apoptosis but did not reduce prodigiosin-inhibited autophagy in K562 cells. Furthermore, prodigiosin treatment in K562 cells reduced the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) and P38, and activated ERK signaling pathway. When ERK1/2 phosphorylation was blocked by PD184352, prodigiosin-induced apoptosis and the inhibition of autophagy decreased significantly. Taken together, these results demonstrated that the ERK signaling pathway was involved in prodigiosin-induced apoptosis and prodigiosin-inhibited autophagy.

31084621|t|Ovarian dysfunction following prenatal exposure to an insecticide, chlordecone, associates with altered epigenetic features.
31084621|a|Chlordecone (CD) is an insecticide that was used in the French West Indies for several years to control the banana root borer pest. Given its nonsignificant degradation, it persists in the environment. CD is a carcinogenic compound with reproductive and developmental toxicity and is a recognized endocrine-disrupting chemical. In this study, we examined the effects of CD on female reproductive system of mice with the focus on epigenetic features in ovary. Our data show that gestational exposure to low dose of CD affects meiotic double-strand breaks repair in female embryos. In adult mice derived from CD-treated pregnant females, we observed delayed puberty, decreased number of primordial and increased number of atretic follicles. Gene expression analysis revealed that Rcbtb2 and Rbpms genes were not expressed in embryonic gonads. Estrogen signaling- and oocyte maturation-associated genes were downregulated in adult ovaries. The morphological changes were associated with altered epigenetic features: increased H2Aub and increased H3K27me3 and decreased H4ac and H3K4me3 in embryonic oocytes. The DNA damage-associated, gammaH2AX marks were detected in the follicles of treated but not control adult ovaries. We also found reduced H3K4me3 and H4ac in fully grown oocytes of the treated ovaries. The ChIP-seq analysis of H3K4me3 in adult ovaries showed that target genes of ZFP57 and TRIM28, which regulate pluripotency and imprinting, were significantly enriched in altered regions. Our study clearly demonstrates that gestational exposure to a low dose of CD impairs the function of female reproductive system and the changes are associated with altered epigenetic features.

31087103|t|TSPO PET Using [18F]PBR111 Reveals Persistent Neuroinflammation Following Acute Diisopropylfluorophosphate Intoxication in the Rat.
31087103|a|Acute intoxication with organophosphates (OPs) can trigger status epilepticus followed by persistent cognitive impairment and/or electroencephalographic abnormalities. Neuroinflammation is widely posited to influence these persistent neurological consequences. However, testing this hypothesis has been challenging, in part because traditional biometrics preclude longitudinal measures of neuroinflammation within the same animal. Therefore, we evaluated the performance of noninvasive positron emission tomography (PET), using the translocator protein (TSPO) radioligand [18F]PBR111 against classic histopathologic measures of neuroinflammation in a preclinical model of acute intoxication with the OP diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP). Adult male Sprague Dawley rats administered pyridostigmine bromide (0.1 mg/kg, im) 30 min prior to administration of DFP (4 mg/kg, sc), atropine sulfate (2 mg/kg, im) and 2-pralidoxime (25 mg/kg, im) exhibited moderate-to-severe seizure behavior. TSPO PET performed prior to DFP exposure and at 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days postexposure revealed distinct lesions, as defined by increased standardized uptake values (SUV). Increased SUV showed high spatial correspondence to immunohistochemical evidence of neuroinflammation, which was corroborated by cytokine gene and protein expression. Regional SUV metrics varied spatiotemporally with days postexposure and correlated with the degree of neuroinflammation detected immunohistochemically. Furthermore, SUV metrics were highly correlated with seizure severity, suggesting that early termination of OP-induced seizures may be critical for attenuating subsequent neuroinflammatory responses. Normalization of SUV values to a cerebellar reference region improved correlations to all outcome measures and seizure severity. Collectively, these results establish TSPO PET using [18F]PBR111 as a robust, noninvasive tool for longitudinal monitoring of neuroinflammation following acute OP intoxication.

31095167|t|[Implementation of a clinical guideline for detection of gestational diabetes in primary care].
31095167|a|BACKGROUND: Gestational diabetes (GD) impacts maternal and fetal morbidity. In 2012, the World Diabetes Foundation provided financing project in Barranquilla (Colombia), aimed to implement a clinical guide for the diagnosis and treatment of this condition. AIM: To estimate the adherence of the guide in primary care centers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A Cross-sectional study of pregnant women suspected of having gestational diabetes. Pregnant women were classified according to the week of admission to the prenatal control program: &lt; week 24 or later. Women with a fasting blood glucose over 92 mg/dL and under 126 mg/dL or with some positive result to the oral glucose tolerance test were included. RESULTS: Nine percent (1,887 women) of 21,699 registries of pregnant women, were at risk for gestational diabetes. Of these, 1,880 registries with complete data were analyzed. Sixty nine entered the program at less than 24 weeks of pregnancy and 71% had had a fasting blood glucose measured in the first control. In 69.2% of these women, criteria for gestational diabetes was met. A glucose tolerance test was suggested to women with a blood glucose below 92 mg/dl. Among 72% of the latter, the glucose tolerance test met the criteria for gestational diabetes. Among the 498 women who entered the program after 24 weeks of gestation, 68% met the criteria for gestational diabetes with the fasting blood glucose levels. In 90 women, a glucose tolerance test was performed and 80% met the criteria for gestational diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: An adequate adherence to guidelines favors the detection of pregnant women with gestational diabetes.

31100273|t|Protective effect of morin on doxorubicin-induced hepatorenal toxicity in rats.
31100273|a|Although Doxorubicin (DOX) is a widespread drug used in the treatment of cancer, its clinical use is restricted due to its common side effects. In addition, administrating DOX with an antioxidant has recently become a new strategy in preventing the side effects of DOX. The protective effects of morin, a natural flavonoid, against DOX-induced liver and kidney damage in rats were investigated biochemically, immunohistochemically and histopathologically in this study. The experimental procedure was planned as 10 days, and 5 groups consisting of seven rats were formed. Morin was given orally to rats at a dose of 50 and 100 mg/kg for 10 days and DOX was given a single dose of 40 mg/kg intraperitoneally on day 8. In order to determine the protective effect of morin against oxidative stress caused by DOX, reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) enzyme activities were measured in liver and kidney tissues. Liver and kidney tissue damage were determined both histopathologically and by serum alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), urea and creatinine analysis. In order to determine the effect of DOX-induced inflammation and against the effect of morin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) levels were determined in both tissues. Liver and kidney B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) levels were determined biochemically. In addition, Bax expression in liver tissue and aquaporin-2 (AQP-2) and nephrin expression in renal tissue were determined immunohistochemically. It was determined that oxidative damage caused by DOX decreased and improvement of liver and kidney function markers were observed in the groups that were treated with morin. In addition, pre-treatment of morin showed a regulatory effect on TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and NF-kappaB levels. It prevented the increase in DOX-induced Bax expression and decrease in Bcl-2 level, AQP-2 and nephrin expression. Histopathological examination revealed that it prevented tissue damage in liver and kidney tissues.

31100367|t|MiR-187-3p mimic alleviates ischemia-reperfusion-induced pain hypersensitivity through inhibiting spinal P2X7R and subsequent mature IL-1beta release in mice.
31100367|a|BACKGROUND: Ischemia-reperfusion (IR)-induced pain hypersensitivity shares features of neuroinflammation and neuropathic pain, accompanied by overproduction of interleukin (IL)-1beta. Multiple microRNAs (miRs) are dysregulated during IR; among these miRs, miR-187-3p was recently reported to drive IL-1beta release in retinal disease by activating members of the purinergic receptor family. However, the roles of miR-187-3p in the spinal cord are unclear. Thus, we investigated whether miR-187-3p is involved in the pathogenesis of IR-induced pain hypersensitivity by regulating the P2X7R signal and subsequent IL-1beta release. METHODS: A mouse model was established by 5-min occlusion of the aortic arch. Pain hypersensitivity was assessed by the paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) and paw withdrawal latency (PWL). MiR-187-3p, P2X7R, cleaved caspase-1 and mature IL-1beta expression levels were measured by RT-PCR and Western blotting. The in vivo roles of miR-187-3p, P2X7R and IL-1beta were explored by intrathecal treatment with synthetic miRs, selective agonists and antagonists in separate experiments. Double immunofluorescence staining was performed to delineate the cellular distribution of P2X7R and IL-1beta. RESULTS: IR-induced progressively decreased PWT and PWL values were closely related to decreases in miR-187-3p and increases in P2X7R expression levels over time. The functional miR-187-3p/P2X7R pair was preliminarily predicted by a bioinformatic database and confirmed in vivo by quantitative analysis, as mimic-187 greatly increased miR-187-3p but decreased P2X7R expression levels, whereas inhibitor-187 reversed these changes. In contrast, downregulating P2X7R by mimic-187 or A-438079 treatment comparably increased PWT and PWL values in IR-injured mice, while upregulating P2X7R by inhibitor-187 or BzATP treatment decreased PWT and PWL values in sham-operated mice. Moreover, P2X7R and IL-1beta immunoreactivities in each group were changed in the same patterns. This finding was further supported by results showing that downregulating IL-1beta by A-438079 and IL-1beta-neutralizing antibody similarly decreased P2X7R, cleaved caspase-1 and mature IL-1beta expression levels, whereas BzATP treatment increased these levels. Expectedly, mimic-187 treatment preserved PWT and PWL values, with decreased cleaved caspase-1 and mature IL-1beta expression levels, whereas inhibitor-187 reversed these effects. CONCLUSIONS: The spinal miR-187-3p/P2X7R pair functioned in a mouse IR model. Increasing miR-187-3p protected against pain hypersensitivity and mature IL-1beta overproduction, partially through inhibiting P2X7R activation.

31103701|t|Methylglyoxal activates osteoclasts through JNK pathway leading to osteoporosis.
31103701|a|Diabetes mellitus is characterized by chronic hyperglycemia and its diverse complications. Hyperglycemia is associated with inflammatory responses in different organs, and diabetic patients have a higher risk of bone fracture due to increased bone weakness. Methylglyoxal, a reactive advanced glycation end product precursor, is known to have increased level in diabetic patients. The accumulation of methylglyoxal promotes inflammation and it may play a role in diabetes related osteoporosis. In this study, therefore, the underlying mechanism of methylglyoxal on osteoporosis was studied using both animal and cell models. In the animal model, rats were treated with either methylglyoxal or saline as control. In the cell model, the macrophage RAW264.7 was treated with methylglyoxal or vehicle control. Following the treatment, animal samples were harvested for micro-CT and real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses. Cell samples were harvested for MTT assay, RT-PCR, and Western Blotting analyses. In both animals and cell cultures, methylglyoxal was shown to induce osteoclastogenesis by increased gene expression of osteoclast bone biomarkers CTSK, OSCAR and TRACP5. Furthermore, in methylglyoxal-treated macrophages activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinases signaling pathway was observed, and inhibition of JNK activities resulted in down-regulation of osteoclast biomarkers gene expressions. Our results therefore suggested that methylglyoxal may contribute to the progression of diabetes-related osteoporosis and imbalanced bone remodeling through JNK pathway in osteoclasts.

31112703|t|Paederia foetida induces anticancer activity by modulating chromatin modification enzymes and altering pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression in human prostate cancer cells.
31112703|a|Aberrant epigenetic modifications are responsible for tumor development and cancer progression; however, readily reversible. Bioactive molecules from diets are promising to cure cancer by modulating epigenetic marks and changing immune response. These compounds specifically target the activity of DNMTs and HDACs to cure various human cancers. In view of this, we investigated the anticancer and epigenetic regulatory activities of an edible-plant Paederia foetida. The efficacy of methanolic extract of P. foetida leaves (MEPL) was tested for the modulation of epigenetic factors in gene silencing, i.e. DNMT and HDAC and expression pattern of certain tumor-suppressor genes. After treatment of prostate cancer cells (PC-3 and DU-145) with MEPL, lupeol and beta-sitosterol; induction of apoptosis, decrease in cellular-viability and inhibition of cellular-migration were noticed. Simultaneously there was inhibition of DNMT1, HDACs and pro-inflammatory, IL-6, IL1-beta, TNF-alpha and anti-inflammatory, IL-10 genes in cancer and THP1 cell lines. The DNMT1 protein content, enzyme activity and Bcl2 expression decreased significantly; however, expression of E-cadherin (CDH1) and pro-apoptotic gene Bax increased significantly after the treatment of cells with drugs. We conclude plant-derived compounds can be considered to target epigenetic machineries involved with malignant transformation and can open new avenues for cancer therapeutics provoking immune response.

31115591|t|Okadaic acid activates Wnt/beta-catenin-signaling in human HepaRG cells.
31115591|a|The lipophilic phycotoxin okadaic acid (OA) occurs in the fatty tissue and hepatopancreas of filter-feeding shellfish. The compound provokes the diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) syndrome after intake of seafood contaminated with high levels of the DSP toxin. In animal experiments, long-term exposure to OA is associated with an elevated risk for tumor formation in different organs including the liver. Although OA is a known inhibitor of the serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A, the mechanisms behind OA-induced carcinogenesis are not fully understood. Here, we investigated the influence of OA on the beta-catenin-dependent Wnt-signaling pathway, addressing a major oncogenic pathway relevant for tumor development. We analyzed OA-mediated effects on beta-catenin and its biological function, cellular localization, post-translational modifications, and target gene expression in human HepaRG hepatocarcinoma cells treated with non-cytotoxic concentrations up to 50 nM. We detected concentration- and time-dependent effects of OA on the phosphorylation state, cellular redistribution as well as on the amount of transcriptionally active beta-catenin. These findings were confirmed by quantitative live-cell imaging of U2OS cells stably expressing a green fluorescent chromobody which specifically recognize hypophosphorylated beta-catenin. Finally, we demonstrated that nuclear translocation of beta-catenin mediated by non-cytotoxic OA concentrations results in an upregulation of Wnt-target genes. In conclusion, our results show a significant induction of the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin-signaling pathway by OA in human liver cells. Our data contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying OA-induced carcinogenesis.

METHODS: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incubated with DATS (100 muM) for 30 min and then cultured in high-glucose medium (HG, 33 mM) for 24 h for assessment of apoptosis, glutathione (GSH), reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and gene expression using the terminal deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling (TUNEL), flow cytometry, caspase-3 activity, ROS, SOD, and western blot assays as well as JC-1 and MitoTracker Red staining, respectively. RESULTS: DATS treatment significantly inhibited high glucose-induced HUVEC apoptosis by blockage of intracellular and mitochondrial ROS generation, maintenance of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and suppression of high glucose-induced dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) expression. Furthermore, DATS blockage of high glucose-induced mitochondrial fission and apoptosis was through adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation-inhibited Drp1 expression in HUVECs. CONCLUSIONS: DATS demonstrated the ability to inhibit high glucose-induced HUVEC apoptosis via suppression of Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission in an AMPK-dependent fashion.

31121238|t|Changes in thyroid hormone activity disrupt photomotor behavior of larval zebrafish.
31121238|a|High throughput in vitro, in silico, and computational approaches have identified numerous environmental chemicals that interfere with thyroid hormone (TH) activity, and it is posited that human exposures to such chemicals are a contributing factor to neurodevelopmental disorders. However, whether hits in screens of TH activity are predictive of developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) has yet to be systematically addressed. The zebrafish has been proposed as a second tier model for assessing the in vivo DNT potential of TH active chemicals. As an initial evaluation of the feasibility of this proposal, we determined whether an endpoint often used to assess DNT in larval zebrafish, specifically photomotor behavior, is altered by experimentally induced hyper- and hypothyroidism. Developmental hyperthyroidism was simulated by static waterborne exposure of zebrafish to varying concentrations (3-300 nM) of thyroxine (T4) or triiodothyronine (T3) beginning at 6 h post-fertilization (hpf) and continuing through 5 days post-fertilization (dpf). Teratogenic effects and lethality were observed at 4 and 5 dpf in fish exposed to T4 or T3 at concentrations >30 nM. However, as early as 3 dpf, T4 (> 3 nM) and T3 (> 10 nM) significantly increased swimming activity triggered by sudden changes from light to dark, particularly during the second dark period (Dark 2). Conversely, developmental hypothyroidism, which was induced by treatment with 6-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU), morpholino knockdown of the TH transporter mct8, or ablation of thyroid follicles in adult females prior to spawning, generally decreased swimming activity during dark periods, although effects did vary across test days. All effects of developmental hypothyroidism on photomotor behavior occurred independent of teratogenic effects and were most robust during Dark 2. Treatment with the T4 analog, Tetrac, restored photomotor response in mct8 morphants to control levels. Collectively, these findings suggest that while the sensitivity of photomotor behavior in larval zebrafish to detect TH disruption is influenced by test parameters, this test can distinguish between TH promoting and TH blocking activity and may be useful for assessing the DNT potential of TH-active chemicals.

31127318|t|Insights into the activation mechanism of human estrogen-related receptor gamma by environmental endocrine disruptors.
31127318|a|The estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERRgamma, NR3B3) is a constitutively active nuclear receptor which has been proposed to act as a mediator of the low-dose effects of a number of environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) such as the xenoestrogen bisphenol-A (BPA). To better characterize the ability of exogenous compounds to bind and activate ERRgamma, we used a combination of cell-based, biochemical, structural and computational approaches. A purposely created stable cell line allowed for the determination of the EC50s for over 30 environmental ERRgamma ligands, including previously unknown ones. Interestingly, affinity constants (Kds) of the most potent compounds measured by isothermal titration calorimetry were in the 50-500 nM range, in agreement with their receptor activation potencies. Crystallographic analysis of the interaction between the ERRgamma ligand-binding domain (LBD) and compounds of the bisphenol, alkylphenol and naphthol families revealed a partially shared binding mode and minimal alterations of the receptor conformation upon ligand binding. Further biophysical characterizations coupled to molecular dynamics simulations suggested a mechanism through which ERRgamma ligands would exhibit their agonistic properties by preserving the transcriptionally active form of the receptor while rigidifying some loop regions with associated functions. This unique mechanism contrasts with the classical one involving a ligand-induced repositioning and stabilization of the C-terminal activation helix H12.

31132129|t|The TGFbeta1 Receptor Antagonist GW788388 Reduces JNK Activation and Protects Against Acetaminophen Hepatotoxicity in Mice.
31132129|a|Acute liver failure is a serious consequence of acetaminophen (APAP)-induced hepatotoxic liver injury with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFbeta1) is elevated during liver injury and influences hepatocyte senescence during APAP-induced hepatotoxicity. This study investigated TGFbeta1 signaling in the context of inflammation, necrotic cell death, and oxidative stress during APAP-induced liver injury. Male C57Bl/6 mice were injected with 600 mg/kg APAP to generate liver injury in the presence or absence of the TGFbeta receptor 1 inhibitor, GW788388, 1 h prior to APAP administration. Acetaminophen-induced liver injury was characterized using histological and biochemical measures. Transforming growth factor beta 1 expression and signal transduction were assessed using immunohistochemistry, Western blotting and ELISA assays. Hepatic necrosis, liver injury, cell proliferation, hepatic inflammation, and oxidative stress were assessed in all mice. Acetaminophen administration significantly induced necrosis and elevated serum transaminases compared with control mice. Transforming growth factor beta 1 staining was observed in and around areas of necrosis with phosphorylation of SMAD3 observed in hepatocytes neighboring necrotic areas in APAP-treated mice. Pretreatment with GW788388 prior to APAP administration in mice reduced hepatocyte cell death and stimulated regeneration. Phosphorylation of SMAD3 was reduced in APAP mice pretreated with GW788388 and this correlated with reduced hepatic cytokine production and oxidative stress. These results support that TGFbeta1 signaling plays a significant role in APAP-induced liver injury by influencing necrotic cell death, inflammation, oxidative stress, and hepatocyte regeneration. In conclusion, targeting TGFbeta1 or downstream signaling may be a possible therapeutic target for the management of APAP-induced liver injury.

31143956|t|Bisphenol A Promotes the Invasive and Metastatic Potential of Ductal Carcinoma In Situ and Protumorigenic Polarization of Macrophages.
31143956|a|Increased cancer risk and immune disorders linked with exposure to environmental endocrine disruptors like bisphenol A (BPA) have been steadily reported. Nevertheless, the impacts of BPA on the breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) progression and macrophage polarization remain to be elucidated. Here, we analyzed the differentially expressed genes in BPA-exposed DCIS cells and explored BPA effects on DCIS progression and macrophage polarization in vitro and in vivo. Two hundred and ninety-one genes were differentially expressed in 10-8 M BPA-exposed DCIS cells, in which the gene ontology terms of biological processes associated with negative regulation of cell death, cell adhesion, and immune response was enriched. 10-8 M BPA promoted the proliferation and migration of DCIS cells and the migration of macrophages, and upregulated the expression of M1 (NOS2) or M2 markers (Arg-1 and CD206) in macrophages. In coculture system, the migratory capacity of both cells and the expression levels of NOS2, Arg-1, and CD206 in macrophages were significantly enhanced upon 10-8 M BPA. In a DCIS xenograft model, oral exposure to an environmentally human-relevant low dose of 2.5 microg/l BPA for 70 days via drinking water led to an approximately 2-fold promotion in the primary tumor growth rate and a significant enhancement of lymph node metastasis along with increased protumorigenic CD206+ M2 polarization of macrophages. These results demonstrate that BPA acts as an accelerator to promote DCIS progression to invasive breast cancer by affecting DCIS cell proliferation and migration as well macrophage polarization toward a protumorigenic phenotype.

31144504|t|Angiotensin II-Induced Oxidative Stress in Human Endothelial Cells: Modification of Cellular Molecules through Lipid Peroxidation.
31144504|a|Angiotensin (Ang) II is a major bioactive peptide of the renin/angiotensin system and is involved in various cardiovascular functions and diseases. Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor mediates most of the physiological effects of Ang II. Previous studies have revealed that the lipid peroxidation products 4-oxo-2(E)-nonenal (ONE) and 4-hydroxy-2(E)-nonenal (HNE) readily modify the N-terminus and Asp1, Arg2, and His6 residues of Ang II, and these modifications alter the biological activities of Ang II. Ang II is known to stimulate the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that mediate cardiovascular remodeling. Another major consequence of ROS-derived damage is lipid peroxidation, which generates genotoxic aldehydes such as ONE and HNE. This study demonstrated that Ang II induced lipid peroxidation-derived modifications of cellular molecules in EA.hy926 cells, a human vascular endothelial cell line. Ang P (ONE- and ROS-derived N-terminal pyruvamide Ang II) and [His6(HNE)]-Ang II were detected in the medium of EA.hy926 cells incubated with Ang II, and their concentrations increased dose-dependently upon the addition of ascorbic acid (AscA) and CuSO4. Cells were then subjected to metabolic labeling using SILFAC (stable isotope labeling by fatty acids in cell culture) with [13C18]-linoleic acid. Analysis of cellular phospholipids indicated over 90% labeling. [13C9]-Thiadiazabicyclo-ONE-glutathione adduct as well as Ang P and [His6([13C9]-HNE)]-Ang II was detected in the labeled cells upon treatment with Ang II and their concentrations increased in an Ang II dose-dependent manner. Incubation of the labeled cells with losartan, an AT1 receptor blocker, inhibited the formation of modified Ang IIs in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that Ang II induces lipid peroxidation and modification of various cellular molecules and these reactions are mediated by the activation of AT1 receptor. Therefore, lipid peroxidation could be one mechanism by which Ang II contributes to cardiovascular dysfunction.

31150782|t|Platycodin D triggers the extracellular release of programed death Ligand-1 in lung cancer cells.
31150782|a|Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) is an important immune checkpoint for cancer immunotherapy in clinic. In this study, we reported that platycodin D, a natural product isolated from an edible and medicinal plant Platycodon grandiflorus (Jacq.) A. DC., down-regulated the protein level of PD-L1 in lung cancer cells. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence assay showed a weaker surface PD-L1 signal in NCI-H1975 cells after the incubation with platycodin D (10 muM) for 15 min compared to the control group. Jurkat T cells showed enhancive interleukin-2 secretion when co-cultured with platycodin D-treated NCI-H1975 cells, suggesting that platycodin D-induced PD-L1 reduction increases the activation of Jurkat T cells. An augmentation of PD-L1 protein was detected in the cell culture medium from platycodin D treatment group. Chlorpromazine (60 muM) almost abolished the platycodin D-mediated PD-L1 extracellular release and restored the membrane PD-L1. Finally, hemolysis assay exhibited that platycodin D-triggered PD-L1 extracellular release was independent of the hemolytic mechanism. Taken together, our study demonstrates that platycodin D reduces the protein level of PD-L1 in lung cancer cells via triggering its release into the cell culture medium, which sheds new light for the application of natural products in cancer immunotherapy.

31151226|t|Flavin Oxidase-Induced ROS Generation Modulates PKC Biphasic Effect of Resveratrol on Endothelial Cell Survival.
31151226|a|BACKGROUND: Dietary intake of natural antioxidants is thought to impart protection against oxidative-associated cardiovascular diseases. Despite many in vivo studies and clinical trials, this issue has not been conclusively resolved. Resveratrol (RES) is one of the most extensively studied dietary polyphenolic antioxidants. Paradoxically, we have previously demonstrated that high RES concentrations exert a pro-oxidant effect eventually elevating ROS levels leading to cell death. Here, we further elucidate the molecular determinants underpinning RES-induced oxidative cell death. METHODS: Using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), the effect of increasing concentrations of RES on DNA synthesis and apoptosis was studied. In addition, mRNA and protein levels of cell survival or apoptosis genes, as well as protein kinase C (PKC) activity were determined. RESULTS: While high concentrations of RES reduce PKC activity, inhibit DNA synthesis and induce apoptosis, low RES concentrations elicit an opposite effect. This biphasic concentration-dependent effect (BCDE) of RES on PKC activity is mirrored at the molecular level. Indeed, high RES concentrations upregulate the proapoptotic Bax, while downregulating the antiapoptotic Bcl-2, at both mRNA and protein levels. Similarly, high RES concentrations downregulate the cell cycle progression genes, c-myc, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and cyclin D1 protein levels, while low RES concentrations display an increasing trend. The BCDE of RES on PKC activity is abrogated by the ROS scavenger Tempol, indicating that this enzyme acts downstream of the RES-elicited ROS signaling. The RES-induced BCDE on HUVEC cell cycle machinery was also blunted by the flavin inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), implicating flavin oxidase-generated ROS as the mechanistic link in the cellular response to different RES concentrations. Finally, PKC inhibition abrogates the BCDE elicited by RES on both cell cycle progression and pro-apoptotic gene expression in HUVECs, mechanistically implicating PKC in the cellular response to different RES concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide new molecular insight into the impact of RES on endothelial function/dysfunction, further confirming that obtaining an optimal benefit of RES is concentration-dependent. Importantly, the BCDE of RES could explain why other studies failed to establish the cardio-protective effects mediated by natural antioxidants, thus providing a guide for future investigation looking at cardio-protection by natural antioxidants.

31153982|t|Hesperetin relieves cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury by mitigating oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis.
31153982|a|Although cisplatin is an effective anticancer drug, its clinical application is limited due to various side effects, especially nephrotoxicity. In this study, we investigated the protective effects and possible mechanisms of hesperetin on cisplatin-induced kidney damage. In vitro, hesperetin significantly attenuated oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by reducing ROS levels in cisplatin-treated HK-2 cells. Simultaneously, hesperetin activated the Nrf2 signaling pathway and regulated its downstream genes, including NQO1 and HO-1. In vivo, hesperetin could significantly attenuate cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (SCr). Furthermore, hesperetin clarifies cisplatin-induced oxidative stress by reducing MDA/MPO levels and increasing SOD/GSH levels. In addition, from the histopathological analysis of the kidney, hesperetin significantly reduced the nephrotoxicity caused by cisplatin compared with the cisplatin group. Moreover, western blotting of renal tissue revealed that hesperetin activates Nrf2 in a dose-dependent manner, attenuates the MAPK signaling pathway against inflammation, and inhibits the expression of apoptotic proteins to protect kidneys from AKI caused by cisplatin. Altogether, these findings suggest that hesperetin may be a potential protectant against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity.

31154625|t|Involvement of Interferon Regulatory Factor 7 in Nicotine's Suppression of Antiviral Immune Responses.
31154625|a|Nicotine, the active ingredient in tobacco smoke, suppresses antiviral responses. Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) regulate transcription of type I interferons (IFNs) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in this response. IRF7 is a key member of the IRF family. Expression of Irf7 is elevated in the brains of virus-infected animals, including human immunodeficiency virus-1 transgenic (HIV-1Tg) rats. We hypothesized that IRF7 affects nicotine's modulation of antiviral responses. Using CRISPR/Cas9 system, IRF7-mutant cell lines were created from human embryonic kidney 293FT cells in which 16 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) were detected. Decreased expression of IRF7 was confirmed at both the mRNA and protein levels, as was IRF7-regulated cell growth in two IRF7-mutant cell lines, designated IRF7-Delta7 and IRF7-Delta11. In IRF7-Delta7 cells, expression of two nAChR genes, CHRNA3 and CHRNA9, changed modestly. After stimulation with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) (0.25 mug/ml) for 4 h to mimic viral infection, 293FT wild-type (WT) and IRF7-Delta7 cells were treated with 0, 1, or 100 muM nicotine for 24 h, which increased IFN-beta expression in both types of cells but elevation was higher in WT cells (p < 0.001). Expression was significantly suppressed in WT cells (p < 0.001) but not in IRF7-Delta7 cells by 24-h nicotine exposure. Poly I:C stimulation increased mRNA expression of retinoic-acid-inducible protein I (RIG-I), melanoma-differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISG3) complex, and IFN-stimulated genes (IRF7, ISG15, IFIT1, OAS1); nicotine attenuated mRNA expression only in WT cells. Overall, IRF7 is critical to nicotine's effect on the antiviral immune response. Graphical Abstract Involvement of IRF7 in nicotine's suppression of poly I:C-induced antiviral immune responses. PAMPs, such as a synthetic viral analogue of dsRNA poly I:C attack cells, will be recognized by PRRs, and the host innate immunity against viral infection will be activated. PRRs signaling trigger phosphorylation of IRF7 and IRF3 to induce their translocation to the nucleus and result in the production of type I IFNs. Then IFNs bind to IFNAR to activate the transcription factor ISGF3, a complex consisting of STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9. Further, it induces the expression of ISGs, including IFIT1, OAS1, IRF7, ISG15, etc. Nicotine suppresses the immune responses stimulated by poly I:C. In the IRF7-mutant cells, nicotine's suppressive effects on poly I:C-stimulated immune responses were restrained.

31157476|t|Protective effects of cynaroside on oxidative stress in retinal pigment epithelial cells.
31157476|a|Cynaroside is a flavonoid compound proved to possess antioxidant activity, but its protective effect on age-related macular degeneration still remains unclear. In this study, the protective effects of cynaroside on oxidative stress and apoptosis in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) were investigated. Results showed that cynaroside effectively attenuated the decrease of cell activity induced by H2 O2 . The total reactive oxygen species can be remitted by decreasing malondialdehyde level, as well as increasing glutathione level, and superoxide dismutase and catalase activities. In addition, Western blot analysis indicated that cynaroside protected ARPE-19 cells from apoptosis through downregulation of caspase-3 protein activation which was controlled by the upstream proteins Bcl-2 and Bax. It was finally proved that cynaroside could enhance the antioxidant and antiapoptotic ability in ARPE-19 cells by promoting the expression of p-Akt.

31165168|t|Toxicoproteomic Analysis of Poly(ADP-ribose)-associated Proteins Induced by Oxidative Stress in Human Proximal Tubule Cells.
31165168|a|2,3,5-Tris-(glutathion-S-yl)hydroquinone (TGHQ) is a nephrotoxic and nephrocarcinogenic metabolite of hydroquinone. TGHQ generates ROS, causing DNA strand breaks, hyperactivation of PARP-1, increases in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i), and cell death. PARP-1 catalyzes the attachment of ADP-ribose polymers (PAR) to target proteins. In human kidney proximal tubule cells (HK-2), ROS-mediated PARP-1 hyperactivation and elevations in [Ca2+]i are reciprocally coupled. The molecular mechanism of this interaction is unclear. The aim of the present study was to identify ROS-induced PAR-associated proteins to further understand their potential role in cell death. PAR-associated proteins were enriched by immunoprecipitation, identified by LC-MS/MS, and relative abundance was obtained by spectral counting. 356 proteins were PAR-modified following TGHQ treatment. 13 proteins exhibited gene ontology annotations related to calcium. Among these proteins, the general transcription factor II-I (TFII-I) is directly involved in the modulation of [Ca2+]i. TFII-I binding to phospholipase C (PLC) leads to calcium influx via the TRPC3 channel. However, inhibition of TRPC3 or PLC had no effect on TGHQ-mediated cell death, suggesting that their loss of function may be necessary but insufficient to cause cell death. Nevertheless, TGHQ promoted a time-dependent translocation of TFII-I from the nucleus to the cytosol concomitant with a decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation in alpha/beta-TFII-I. Therefore it is likely that ROS have an important impact on the function of TFII-I, such as regulation of transcription, and DNA translesion synthesis. Our data also sheds light on PAR mediated signaling during oxidative stress, and contributes to the development of strategies to prevent PAR-dependent cell death.

31168030|t|The anti-cancer drug gefitinib accelerates Fas-mediated apoptosis by enhancing caspase-8 activation in cancer cells.
31168030|a|Fas/CD95 plays a pivotal role in T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Accumulating evidence has suggested that resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis contributes to the escape of cancer cells from immune destruction, and allows to undergo proliferation and outgrowth of cancer cells. In this study, we found that the anti-cancer drug gefitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), has an ability to enhance Fas-mediated cytotoxicity. In the presence of nontoxic concentrations of gefitinib, Fas-induced activation of caspase-8 and subsequent apoptosis was dramatically promoted, suggesting that gefitinib increases the sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Interestingly, the effects of gefitinib were observed in EGFR or p53 knockout (KO) cells. These observations indicate that both EGFR and p53 are dispensable for the enhancement. On the other hand, gefitinib clearly downregulated heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) as previously reported. Considering that HSP70 contributes to protection of cells against Fas-mediated apoptosis, gefitinib may increase the sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis by downregulating HSP70. Thus, our findings reveal novel properties of gefitinib, which may provide insight into the alternative therapeutic approaches of gefitinib for Fas-resistant tumors.

31168839|t|Some Musings About Differential Energy Metabolism With Ketogenic Diets.
31168839|a|Ketogenic states are of 3 major types: total starvation and those resulting from the consumption of semistarvation, ketogenic diets, and eucaloric ketogenic diets. All are characterized by little or no dietary carbohydrate, resulting in a fat-based metabolism with sustained ketonemia of varying degrees in each state. The latter 2 diets are clinically useful with important impacts on both aspects of the energy balance equation with increased satiety and less hunger on the intake side and probably increased energy expenditure on the output side; both may have important implications for the successful long-term management of obesity. Consideration of older research regarding the hormonal response to carbohydrate-free dieting and recent findings on hepatic glycogen status that occurs with sustained ketonemia support the likelihood that there are profound differences in 24-hour gluconeogenesis rates between ketogenic diets and balanced diets containing substantial carbohydrate. This metabolic distinction could have a meaningful impact to increase the thermic effect of feeding and daily energy expenditure amounting to 100 kcal/d or more with each of the ketogenic diets.

31173752|t|The protective effects of liraglutide on AD-like neurodegeneration induced by oxidative stress in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells.
31173752|a|Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) has neuroprotective properties in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, our aim is to explore the neuroprotective effects of liraglutide, a GLP-1 analogue, on AD-like neurodegeneration induced by H2O2 in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Cytotoxicity was determined by MTT assay and lactate dehydrogenase level was monitored by LDH assay. The level of lipid peroxidation and cell apoptosis rate were measured by malondialdehyde (MDA) assay and Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide (PI) staining. Western blotting was used to assess the expression of Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3, tau and the Akt/GSK-3beta. Liraglutide pre-treatment enhanced cell viability with reduced cytotoxicity, lipid peroxidationand and apoptosis. In addition, pre-treatment of liraglutide displayed that increased the expression of the pro-survival Bcl-2 and reduced pro-apoptotic Bax with ameliorated the hyperphosphorylation of tau and Akt/GSK-3beta signaling pathway in H2O2 stressed SH-SY5Y cells. These finding provided evidences that liraglutide protected the H2O2 induced AD-like neurodegeneration through improving Akt/GSK-3beta signaling pathway. These results suggest that liraglutide may have potential values for the treatment for AD.

31176653|t|Tricetin protects against 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity in Parkinson's disease model by activating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway and preventing mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathway.
31176653|a|Apoptosis of DA neurons is a contributing cause of disability and death for Parkinson's disease (PD). In this experiment, the neuroprotective effect of Tricetin was examined in PD models both in vitro and in vivo. The results suggested that 6-OHDA-induced cytotoxicity was accompanied by an increase in ROS generation, an increase in caspase-3 protein activity, an increase in Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and an increase in the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, but the pretreatment with Tricetin significantly improved cell viability and suppressed mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, Tricetin also induced the protein expression of Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) and its transcriptional activation, resulting in the up-regulated expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which conferred neuroprotection against 6-OHDA-induced oxidative damage. Results from molecular docking indicated that Tricetin could be a potent competitive inhibitor of the Keap1-Nrf2 Protein Protein Interaction (PPI). Finally, in vivo findings were confirmed in the 6-OHDA-PD C. elegans model. Thus, Tricetin may be an attractive therapeutic candidate for the neuroprotection.

31189234|t|[Effects of paraquat on the proliferation of human neural stem cells via DNA methylation].
31189234|a|Objective: To investigate the effects of Paraquat on neural stem cell proliferation in vitro and explore the its mechanism based on DNA methylation pathway. Methods: Nestin, beta-tubulin III, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were detected by indirect immunofluorescence assay to evaluate self renewal and differentiation potentia of ReNcell CX human neural stem. The cells were treated with terminal concentrations of 0, 5, 25, 50, and 100mumol/L PQ for 24 hours, and the cells were induced by 50 mumol/L PQ for different time (6, 12, 24, 48 h). Cell viability was determined by MTT assay. The proliferation of neural stem cells was evaluated using Sox2/Brdu and Nestin/Brdu double immunofluorescence staining. The global DNA methylation level was assayed by MethyflashTM methylated DNA Quantification kit. The expression levels of Dnmts mRNA and protein were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction(qRT-PCR) and Western blot, respectively. Results: Immunofluorescence showed that nestin was primarily expressed in proliferative neural stem cell and peotein biomarkers (beta-tubulin III, GFAP) for neuron and astrocyte were expressed in differentiated cells. MTT assay showed PQ induced cell survival rate decrease in a time and dose dependent manner. Double immunfluorescence staining of cells showed colocalization of Sox2 and Brdu. The percentage of Brdu/Sox2 positive cells was significantly lower in the PQ-exposed (25, 50, 100mumol/L PQ treatment) groups compared to control (P&lt;0.05); Meanwhile, The percentage of Brdu/Nestin positive cells was also significantly lower in the PQ-exposed(50,100mumol/L PQ treatment) groups compared to control (P&lt;0.05). The results of global DNA methylation revealed a significant decrease in PQ-exposed groups (P&lt;0.05). Western blot showed that compared with control group, the protein and mRNA levels of Dnmt1, Dnmt3a in PQ-exposed group were significantly decreased (P&lt;0.05), but there was a significant increase in expression level of Dnmt3b in 50, 100 mumol/L PQ-treated group(P&lt;0.05). Conclusion: Paraquat could inhibite the proliferation of human neural stem cells through reducing the level of DNA methylation reaction by suppressing the protein expression and transcription of DNA methylated transferase(Dnmts).

31195007|t|Receptor-binding affinities of bisphenol A and its next-generation analogs for human nuclear receptors.
31195007|a|An endocrine-disrupting chemical Bisphenol A (BPA) binds specifically to a nuclear receptor (NR) named ERRgamma. Although the importance of receptor-binding evaluation for human NRs is often stressed, the binding characteristics of so-called next-generation (NextGen) bisphenol compounds are still poorly understood. The ultimate objective of this investigation was to evaluate BPA and its NextGen analogs for their abilities to bind to 21 human NRs, the greatest members of NRs for which tritium-labeled specific ligands were available. After establishing the detailed assay conditions for each NR, the receptor binding affinities of total 11 bisphenols were evaluated in competitive binding assays. The results clearly revealed that BPA and the NextGen bisphenols of BPAF, BPAP, BPB, BPC, BPE, and BPZ were highly potent against one or more of NRs such as CAR, ERalpha, ERbeta, ERRgamma, and GR, with IC50 values of 3.3-73 nM. These bisphenols were suggested strongly to be disruptive to these NRs. BPM and BPP also appeared to be disruptive, but less potently. BPF exhibited only weak effects and only against estrogen-related NRs. Surprisingly, most doubtful bisphenol BPS was supposed not to be disruptive. The NRs to which BPA and NextGen bisphenols did not bind were RARalpha, RARbeta, RARgamma, and VDR. PPARgamma, RORalpha, RORbeta, RORgamma, RXRalpha, RXRbeta, and RXRgamma, exhibited very weak interaction with these bisphenols. The ten remaining NRs, namely, ERRgamma, ERbeta, ERalpha, CAR, GR, PXR, PR, AR, LXRbeta, and LXRalpha, showed distinctly strong binding to some bisphenols in this order, being likely to have consequential endocrine-disruption effects.

31200309|t|Diastereoisomer-specific neurotoxicity of hexabromocyclododecane in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells.
31200309|a|Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) is a widely applied brominated flame retardant (BFR) and is regarded as a persistent organic pollutant. It has been found in human tissues and has the potential to cause neurological disorders. However, our understanding of HBCD neurotoxicity at the diastereoisomer level remains lacking. Here, we investigated the neurotoxicity of three HBCD diastereoisomers, i.e., alpha-, beta-, and gamma-HBCD, in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. Results showed that the HBCD diastereoisomers decreased cell viability, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and impaired cytoskeleton development. Typical morphological features and apoptosis rates showed that the HBCD diastereoisomers induced SH-SY5Y cell apoptosis. The expression levels of several cell apoptosis-related genes and proteins, including Bax, caspase-3, caspase-9, cytochrome c, Bcl-2, and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), as well as the cell cycle arrest, DNA damage, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) consumption, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and intracellular calcium ion (Ca2+) levels, were examined. Results showed that the HBCD diastereoisomer neurotoxicity was ranked beta-HBCD &gt; gamma-HBCD &gt; alpha-HBCD. The cell apoptosis and caspase expression levels of the three HBCD diastereoisomers followed the same order, suggesting that caspase-dependent apoptosis may be one mechanism responsible for the structure-selective HBCD diastereoisomer neurotoxicity. The levels of intracellular Ca2+ and ROS increased significantly. The ROS levels were ordered beta-HBCD &gt; gamma-HBCD &gt; alpha-HBCD, whereas those of intracellular Ca2+ were gamma-HBCD &gt; beta-HBCD &gt; alpha-HBCD. Thus, ROS may be a key factor regulating the neurotoxicity of HBCD diastereoisomers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report on the diastereoisomer-specific toxicity of HBCD in human neural cells and on the possible mechanisms responsible for the selective neurotoxicity of HBCD diastereoisomers.

31207347|t|Mebendazole induces apoptosis via C-MYC inactivation in malignant ascites cell line (AGP01).
31207347|a|The objective of study was to examine the role of MBZ on malignant ascites cells and the involvement of C-MYC. Comet assay was used to assess the genotoxic effects of MBZ in AGP01 cells and human lymphocytes; differential staining by ethidium bromide and acridine orange, caspase 3/7 and flow cytometry assay was done to access the mechanisms of apoptosis and cell cycle analysis of MBZ in AGP01 cells. C-MYC amplification, C-MYC mRNA and C-MYC protein expression were evaluated by FISH, RT-qPCR and Western blotting, respectively. In addition, cytotoxicity of MBZ was evaluated in AGP01 and AGP01 shRNA MYC by MTT. MBZ significantly increased the damage index and no produced in human lymphocytes. MBZ caused remarkable cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 and G2/M phases at 0.5muM and 1.0 muM, respectively and induced significantly apoptosis in higher concentrations. Additionally, MBZ (0.5 muM and 1.0 muM) increased caspase 3 and 7 activities. MBZ decreased signals, C-MYC mRNA and C-MYC protein expression in AGP01 cells. MBZ induced lower cell viability in AGP01 cells compared AGP01 shRNA MYC in the same concentration. Therefore, our results show the evidence of C-MYC gene as one of the pathways by which MBZ induces cell death in gastric cancer cells.

31220555|t|Enhancing autophagy by down-regulating GSK-3beta alleviates cisplatin-induced ototoxicity in vivo and in vitro.
31220555|a|Previous study reported that either selective GSK-3beta inhibitor or up-regulating autophagy can alleviate cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. Other studies indicate that the activity of GSK-3beta is closely associated with the autophagy level. The purpose of this study is to primarily explore the role of autophagy in the alleviation effect of GSK-3beta inhibition on cisplatin-induced ototoxicity in vivo and in vitro. We observed the autophagy changes induced by GSK-3beta inhibitor in outer hair cells (OHCs) in a cisplatin-induced ototoxicity rat model. In addition, autophagy inhibitor 3-MA was used in vitro experiments to observe the influence of autophagy inhibition on the cell protection effect due to GSK-3beta inactivation. The relationship among autophagy, GSK-3beta and cell damage were inferred. Negative regulation of GSK-3beta significantly enhanced autophagy and alleviated cisplatin-induced hearing loss, OHC death in vivo and apoptosis in vitro. The autophagy inhibitor 3-MA inverted the protective effect of negative regulation of GSK-3beta. These results indicated that enhancing autophagy may be a key downstream effect of GSK-3beta inhibition in the alleviation of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity both in vivo and in vitro.

31226288|t|Actinomycin D inhibits the expression of the cystine/glutamate transporter xCT via attenuation of CD133 synthesis in CD133+ HCC.
31226288|a|Liver cancer is one of the most frequently occurring types of cancer with high mortality rate. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) frequently metastasizes to lung, portal vein, and portal lymph nodes and most HCCs show strong resistance to conventional anticancer drugs. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are considered to be responsible for resistance to therapies. Hence, recent advancements in the use of liver cancer stem cells (LCSCs) are rapidly gaining recognition as an efficient and organized means for developing antitumor agents. We aimed to use a non-target-based high-throughput screening (HTS) approach to specifically target alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)+/cluster of differentiation (CD)133+ HCC present in mixed populations of HCC cells and hepatocytes. Herein, we identified actinomycin D (ActD) as a potential antitumor agent that significantly inhibits activity of LCSCs without affecting the co-cultured hepatocytes. To determine the mechanism of ActD-induced tumor-specificity in LCSC, we applied various cell-based assay models in vitro. In fact, ActD significantly increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and DNA damage in Huh7 HCC cells, but not in Fa2N-4 cells, immortalized hepatocytes. Treatment of spheroid-forming LCSCs with ActD effectively decreased spheroid formation and the CD133+ HCC cell population. Importantly, these ActD-mediated effects are a result of inhibition of cystine/glutamate transporter xCT expression, via attenuation of CD133 synthesis. These results indicate that ActD suppresses stemness and malignant properties in HCC cells through destabilization of xCT, by inhibition of CD133 expression in LCSCs. The effects of ActD on LCSCs provide novel therapeutic strategies for targeting cancer stem-like cells in liver cancer.

31230753|t|The effect of bisphenol a exposure onto endothelial and decidualized stromal cells on regulation of the invasion ability of trophoblastic spheroids in in vitro co-culture model.
31230753|a|Bisphenol A (BPA) is a kind of environmental endocrine disruptors (EEDs) that interfere embryo implantation. Trophoblast invasion plays a crucial role during embryo implantation. In this study, the effects of BPA on invasion ability of human trophoblastic Jeg-3 spheroids and regulation of endothelial and stromal cells on trophoblastic spheroids invasion, and its possible mechanism were investigated. The results showed that BPA at 10 and 100 muM can inhibit the attachment of Jeg-3 spheroid onto Ishikawa cells. BPA at 1-100 muM also activate ERE-Luc reporter expression in the transfected cells, which was through the ERalpha, but not ERbeta or GPR30 binding. Endothelial receptivity ability was harmed by BPA treatment since receptivity markers of LIF, EGF, MUC1 and integrin alphaVbeta3 were decreased after BPA treatment. The invasion ability of trophoblastic spheroids generated from Jeg-3 cell line was inhibited by BPA and this effect was mediated through canonical ERs pathway and MMP2/MMP9 down-regulation and TIMP1/PAI-1 up-regulation. Besides, BPA treated decidualized stromal cells suppressed Jeg-3 spheroid outgrowth and invasion in co-culture assay. Our study would give a better understanding on the possible mechanism of BPA effect on human embryo implantation process.

31233785|t|A comprehensive evaluation of anti-diabetic drugs on nuclear receptor PXR platform.
31233785|a|Pregnane &amp; Xenobiotic Receptor (PXR), one of the members of nuclear receptor superfamily, acts as a 'master-regulator' of drug metabolism and disposition machinery (DMD). Activation of PXR enables detoxification and elimination of toxic xenobiotics/endobiotics, and defends our body against chemical insults. On the contrary, PXR activation also imposes a serious concern for drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Such DDIs could either decrease the efficacy or lead to accumulation of co-administered drugs at toxic level. Therefore, it is desirable that during drug development process the small drug molecules are screened on PXR-platform prior to their clinical trial and prevent late stage failures. In view of this, we have selected a group of anti-diabetic drug molecules to examine if the success and potential failure of small molecule modulators can be pre-assessed and judiciously correlated on PXR platform. For this purpose, we have examined the PXR activation potential of the selected anti-diabetic drugs. Subsequent to screening of these anti-diabetic drugs, we elaborated the study further with rosiglitazone and pioglitazone (thiazolidinediones, TZDs) which are oral anti-diabetic formulations and have been in controversy owing to their association with cardiotoxicity and bladder cancer respectively. Our study revealed that some of the selected anti-diabetic drugs possess PXR activation potential, implying that these can up-regulate the expression of CYP3A4, UGT1A1, MDR1 and thereby can be predicted to inflict undesirable consequences.

31238027|t|Vitamin K3 (menadione) suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal-transition and Wnt signaling pathway in human colorectal cancer cells.
31238027|a|Tumor recurrence and metastasis decrease the survival rate of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Menadione reduces the numbers and incidences of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine induced colon tumors in mouse but the mechanism of anticancer activity of menadione in colorectal cancer is not very clear. Since Wnt signaling is constitutively active in CRC and it aggravates the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), the regulation of EMT and Wnt signaling by menadione (vitamin K3) was investigated in CRC cells. Menadione showed cytotoxicity against human CRC cells (SW480 and SW620) and human primary colon cancer cells but was relatively ineffective against the cells from human normal colon (CRL-1790) and human primary colon epithelial cells. Menadione suppressed invasion, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in human CRC cells by upregulating the expression of E-cadherin (CDH1), ZO-1 and downregulating that of N-cadherin (CDH2), Vimentin (VIM), ZEB1, MMP2 and MMP9. Menadione decreased TOPFlash/FOPFlash luciferase activity and expression of several downstream targets of Wnt signaling and coactivators such as beta-catenin (CTNNB1), TCF7L2, Bcl9l, p300 (EP300) and cyclin D1 (CCND1) was suppressed. Menadione induced differentiation and increased apoptotic cell population in SubG0 phase of cell cycle in SW480 and SW620 cells. The ability of menadione to suppress EMT, migration, invasion, Wnt signaling, cell proliferation and induce Sub G0 arrest, highlights its potential to be considered for intensive preclinical and clinical investigation in CRC.

31241159|t|The Protective Roles of PPARalpha Activation in Triptolide-induced Liver Injury.
31241159|a|Triptolide (TP), one of the main active ingredients in Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F, is clinically used to treat immune diseases but is known to cause liver injury. The aim of this study was to investigate the biomarkers for TP-induced hepatotoxicity in mice and to determine potential mechanisms of its liver injury. LC/MS-based metabolomics was used to determine the metabolites that were changed in TP-induced liver injury. The accumulation of long-chain acylcarnitines in serum indicated that TP exposure disrupted endogenous peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) signaling. TP-induced liver injury could be alleviated by treatment of mice with the PPARalpha agonist fenofibrate, while the PPARalpha antagonist GW6471 increased hepatotoxicity. Furthermore, fenofibrate did not protect Ppara-/- mice from TP-induced liver injury, suggesting an essential role for the PPARalpha in the protective effect of fenofibrate. Elevated long-chain acylcarnitines may protect TP-induced liver injury through activation of the NOTCH-NRF2 pathway as revealed in primary mouse hepatocytes and in vivo. In agreement with these observations in mice, the increase of long-chain acylcarnitines was observed in the serum of patients with cholestatic liver injury compared to heathy volunteers. These data demonstrated the role of PPARalpha and long-chain acylcarnitines in TP-induced hepatotoxicity, and suggest that modulation of PPARalpha may protect against drug-induced liver injury.

31248982|t|Benzoquinone, a leukemogenic metabolite of benzene, catalytically inhibits the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN2 and alters STAT1 signaling.
31248982|a|Protein tyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor type 2 (PTPN2) is mainly expressed in hematopoietic cells, where it negatively regulates growth factor and cytokine signaling. PTPN2 is an important regulator of hematopoiesis and immune/inflammatory responses, as evidenced by loss-of-function mutations of PTPN2 in leukemia and lymphoma and knockout mice studies. Benzene is an environmental chemical that causes hematological malignancies, and its hematotoxicity arises from its bioactivation in the bone marrow to electrophilic metabolites, notably 1,4-benzoquinone, a major hematotoxic benzene metabolite. Although the molecular bases for benzene-induced leukemia are not well-understood, it has been suggested that benzene metabolites alter topoisomerases II function and thereby significantly contribute to leukemogenesis. However, several studies indicate that benzene and its hematotoxic metabolites may also promote the leukemogenic process by reacting with other targets and pathways. Interestingly, alterations of cell-signaling pathways, such as Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), have been proposed to contribute to benzene-induced malignant blood diseases. We show here that 1,4-benzoquinone directly impairs PTPN2 activity. Mechanistic and kinetic experiments with purified human PTPN2 indicated that this impairment results from the irreversible formation (k inact = 645 m-1 s-1) of a covalent 1,4-benzoquinone adduct at the catalytic cysteine residue of the enzyme. Accordingly, cell experiments revealed that 1,4-benzoquinone exposure irreversibly inhibits cellular PTPN2 and concomitantly increases tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and expression of STAT1-regulated genes. Our results provide molecular and cellular evidence that 1,4-benzoquinone covalently modifies key signaling enzymes, implicating it in benzene-induced malignant blood diseases.

31251792|t|Evaluation of eluforsen, a novel RNA oligonucleotide for restoration of CFTR function in in vitro and murine models of p.Phe508del cystic fibrosis.
31251792|a|Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the epithelial chloride channel CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. The most common mutation is a deletion of three nucleotides leading to the loss of phenylalanine at position 508 (p.Phe508del) in the protein. This study evaluates eluforsen, a novel, single-stranded, 33-nucleotide antisense oligonucleotide designed to restore CFTR function, in in vitro and in vivo models of p.Phe508del CF. The aims of the study were to demonstrate cellular uptake of eluforsen, and its efficacy in functional restoration of p.Phe508del-CFTR both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, the effect of eluforsen was investigated in human CF pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells and human bronchial epithelial cells. Two mouse models were used to evaluate eluforsen in vivo. In vitro, eluforsen improved chloride efflux in CF pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell cultures and increased short-circuit current in primary human bronchial epithelial cells, both indicating restoration of CFTR function. In vivo, eluforsen was taken up by airway epithelium following oro-tracheal administration in mice, resulting in systemic exposure of eluforsen. In female F508del-CFTR mice, eluforsen significantly increased CFTR-mediated saliva secretion (used as a measure of CFTR function, equivalent to the sweat test in humans). Similarly, intranasal administration of eluforsen significantly improved nasal potential difference (NPD), and therefore CFTR conductance, in two CF mouse models. These findings indicate that eluforsen improved CFTR function in cell and animal models of p.Phe508del-CFTR-mediated CF and supported further development of eluforsen in human clinical trials, where eluforsen has also been shown to improve CFTR activity as measured by NPD.

31251971|t|2,3'4,4',5-Pentachlorobiphenyl induces hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation through pyruvate kinase M2-dependent glycolysis.
31251971|a|Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are classic persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and are associated with the progression of many cancers, including liver cancer. The present study investigated the effect of 2,3'4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB118) on hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation and its underlying mechanisms. The results indicated that PCB118 exposure promotes the proliferation and glycolysis of hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC-7721 cells. Moreover, PCB118 exposure increased the expression level of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) and its nuclear translocation, whereas treatment with PKM2 shRNA suppressed the induction of cell proliferation and glycolysis by PCB118. PCB118 stimulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by activating nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase. Treatment with the antioxidants N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) prevented PCB118-induced effects on PKM2, cell proliferation and glycolysis. Furthermore, we found that PCB118 activated NADPH oxidase through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in SMMC-7721 cells. Consistently, treatment with AhR shRNA suppressed PCB118-induced effects on PKM2, cell proliferation and glycolysis. Overall, these results indicated that PCB118 promotes HCC cell proliferation via PKM2-dependent upregulation of glycolysis, which is mediated by AhR/NADPH oxidase-induced ROS production.

31255635|t|Tetrandrine and cepharanthine induce apoptosis through caspase cascade regulation, cell cycle arrest, MAPK activation and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal modification in glucocorticoid resistant human leukemia Jurkat T cells.
31255635|a|Tetrandrine (TET) and cepharanthine (CEP) are two bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids isolated from the traditional herbs. Recent molecular investigations firmly supported that TET or CEP would be a potential candidate for cancer chemotherapy. Prognosis of patients with glucocorticoid resistant T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) remains poor; here we examined the anti-T-ALL effects of TET and CEP and the underlying mechanism by using the glucocorticoid resistant human leukemia Jurkat T cell line in vitro. TET and CEP significantly inhibited cell viabilities and induced apoptosis in dose- and time-dependent manner. Further investigations showed that TET or CEP not only upregulated the expression of initiator caspases such as caspase-8 and 9, but also increased the expression of effector caspases such as caspase-3 and 6. As the important markers of apoptosis, p53 and Bax were both upregulated by the treatment of TET and CEP. However, TET and CEP paradoxically increased the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, and activated the survival protein NF-kappaB, leading to high expression of p-NF-kappaB. Cell cycle arrest at S phase accompanied by increase in the amounts of cyclin A2 and cyclin B1, and decrease in cylcin D1 amount in cells treated with TET or CEP will be another possible mechanism. During the process of apoptosis in Jurkat T cells, treatment with TET or CEP also increased the phosphorylation of JNK and p38. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway modification appears to play significant role in the Jurkat T cell apoptosis induced by TET or CEP. Moreover, TET and CEP seemed to downregulate the expressions of p-PI3K and mTOR in an independent way from Akt, since these two drugs strongly stimulated the p-Akt expression. These results provide fundamental insights into the clinical application of TET or CEP for the treatment of patients with relapsed T-ALL.

31270303|t|Evaluation of M1-microglial activation by neurotoxic metals using optimized organotypic cerebral slice cultures.
31270303|a|M1-microglia (neurotoxic microglia) regulate neuronal development and cell death and are involved in many pathologies in the brain. Although organotypic brain slice cultures are widely used to study the crosstalk between neurons and microglia, little is known about the properties of microglia in the mouse cerebral cortex slices. Here, we aimed to optimize the mouse cerebral slice cultures that reflect microglial functions and evaluate the effects of neurotoxic metals on M1-microglial activation. Most microglia in the cerebral slices prepared from postnatal day (P) 7 mice were similar to mature microglia in adult mice brains, but those in the slices prepared from P2 mice were immature, which is a conventional preparation condition. The degree of expression of M1-microglial markers (CD16 and CD32) and inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta) by lipopolysaccharide, a representative microglia activator, in the cerebral slices of P7 mice were higher than that in the slices of P2 mice. These results indicate that M1-microglial activation can be evaluated more accurately in the cerebral slices of P7 mice than in those of P2 mice. Therefore, we next examined the effects of various neurotoxic metals on M1-microglial activation using the cerebral slices of P7 mice and found that methylmercury stimulated the activation to M1-microglia, but arsenite, lead, and tributyltin did not induce such activation. Altogether, the optimized mouse cerebral slice cultures used in this study can be a helpful tool to study the influence of various chemicals on the central nervous system in the presence of functionally mature microglia.

31270304|t|Bisphenol A induces cholesterol biosynthesis in HepG2 cells via SREBP-2/HMGCR signaling pathway.
31270304|a|Bisphenol A (BPA), an environmental chemical to which humans are commonly exposed, has been shown to increase cholesterol level but the molecular mechanism is not clear. Since cholesterol biosynthesis plays an important role in elevating cholesterol level, the aim of the present study is to explore the effects of BPA on cholesterol biosynthesis in HepG2 cells and its possible mechanisms. HepG2 cells were treated with different concentrations of BPA for 24 hr, the total cholesterol level and the activity of 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) were measured using commercial enzymatic assay kits, and the mRNA and protein expression levels of sterol regulatory element binding protein-2(SREBP-2) and HMGCR were analyzed by qPCR, Western blotting and immunofluorescence, respectively. After treating HepG2 cells with different concentrations (0.1 nM~10 microM) of BPA for 24 hr, we found that BPA at the environmentally relevant concentrations of 1 nM and 10 nM significantly increased the total cholesterol content, the activity and expression of HMGCR in HepG2 cells, but at 100 nM, 1 microM and 10 microM doses, BPA had no stimulatory effect on cholesterol biosynthesis. The whole dose-response relationship follows non-monotonic dose responses, such as an inverted U-shape. Using human SREBP-2 small interfering RNA, we further discovered that the stimulatory effects of BPA on cholesterol biosynthesis and HMGCR expression could be prevented by blockade of the SREBP-2 pathway. This study provides important implications for understanding the potential lipotoxicity of BPA exposure, and it also indicates that low-dose BPA induces hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis through upregulating the SREBP-2/HMGCR signaling pathway.

31283913|t|Preconditioning with hydrogen sulfide ameliorates cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in a mouse model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion.
31283913|a|Ischemic stroke and reperfusion injury are a common and serve medical situation in the elderly population. H2S is a gas neuromodulator which also possesses anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and is found to play neuroprotective effect in neurodegenerative diseases. This study investigated the effect of endogenous and exogenous H2S in a mouse model of ischemic stroke. 129P2-Cbstm1Unc/J mice with heterozygous mutants in H2S generating enzyme cystathionine beta-synthase were used to study the effect of endogenous H2S. H2S donor NaHS was used as exogenous H2S. Animals were pretreated with H2S and then subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion surgery. Behavioral outcome was evaluated by novel object recognition test. Inflammatory cytokines were measured using ELISA. Western blot was used to detect the activation of NF-kappaB. Aged 129P2-Cbstm1Unc/J mice showed exaggerated inflammation and more severe cognitive impairment after ischemia, while exogenous H2S treatment inhibited inflammation and attenuated behavioral impairment. The anti-inflammatory effect of H2S was mediated by inhibiting NF-kappaB. Our findings suggest that both endogenous and exogenous H2S are involved in the neuroprotection against ischemia/reperfusion-induced cerebral injury.

31289910|t|Plasma osteopontin levels, but not its myocardial expression, reflect heart failure severity in recently diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy.
31289910|a|BACKGROUND: Elevated levels of the extracellular matrix glycoprotein osteopontin (OPN) may be detected in both myocardium and plasma under various pathological conditions affecting the heart. Several studies demonstrated increased plasma OPN levels in patients with heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), while other studies showed high OPN expression levels in the myocardium of such patients. However, very little is known about OPN levels in both plasma and myocardium of the same individual with DCM. Therefore, we aimed to compare plasma OPN levels and levels of myocardial OPN expression in patients with recent-onset DCM (Ro-DCM). METHODS: We examined plasma OPN as well as creatinine, C-reactive protein (CRP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and troponin I levels in 25 patients with Ro-DCM. Furthermore, all subjects underwent transthoracic echocardiography, selective coronary angiography, and endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) for the assessment of myocardial OPN expression. RESULTS: No significant correlation between myocardial OPN expression and clinical, biochemical, or echocardiographic parameters was found. In log transformation analysis, plasma OPN levels correlated significantly with BNP levels (r = 0.46, p = 0.031), with CRP levels (r = 0.52, p = 0.015), and with early diastolic mitral annular velocity (r = -0.57, p = 0.009). There was a borderline association between the plasma OPN log value and New York Heart Association class (p = 0.053). CONCLUSION: Plasma OPN levels reflect heart failure severity in patients with Ro-DCM. Myocardial OPN expression is not associated with either plasma OPN levels or markers of heart failure in these individuals.

31294067|t|Transcriptome profiling data reveals ubiquitin-specific peptidase 9 knockdown effects.
31294067|a|Ubiquitin specific peptidase 9 (USP9) is a deubiquitinase encoded by a sex-linked gene with a Y-chromosomal form (USP9Y) and an X-chromosomal form (USP9X) that escapes X-inactivation. Since USP9 is a key regulatory gene with sex-linked expression in the human brain, the gene may be of interest for researchers studying molecular gender differences and ubiquitin signaling in the brain. To assess the downstream effects of knocking down USP9X and USP9Y on a transcriptome-wide scale, we have conducted microarray profiling experiments using the human DU145 prostate cancer cell culture model, after confirming the robust expression of both USP9X and USP9Y in this model. By designing shRNA constructs for the specific knockdown of USP9X and the joint knockdown of USP9X and USP9Y, we have compared gene expression changes in both knockdowns to control conditions to infer potential shared and X- or Y-form specific alterations. Here, we provide details of the corresponding microarray profiling data, which has been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO series accession number GSE79376). A biological interpretation of the data in the context of a potential involvement of USP9 in Alzheimer's disease has previously been presented in Koglsberger et al. (2016). To facilitate the re-use and re-analysis of the data for other applications, e.g. the study of ubiquitin signaling and protein turnover control, and the regulation of molecular gender differences in the human brain and brain-related disorders, we provide a more in-depth discussion of the data properties, specifications and possible use cases.

31307187|t|Paeonol Reverses Adriamycin Induced Cardiac Pathological Remodeling through Notch1 Signaling Reactivation in H9c2 Cells and Adult Zebrafish Heart.
31307187|a|Adriamycin is a commonly prescribed chemotherapeutic drug for a wide range of cancers. Adriamycin causes cardiotoxicity as an adverse effect that limits its clinical application in cancer treatment. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the toxicity it causes in heart cells. Disruption of inherent cardiac repair mechanism is the least understood mechanism of Adriamycin-induced cardiotoxicity. Adriamycin induces pathological remodeling in cardiac cells by promoting apoptosis, hypertrophy and fibrosis. We found that Adriamycin inhibited Notch1 in a time and dose dependent manner in H9c2 cells. We used Paeonol, a Notch1 activator and analyzed the markers of apoptosis, hypertrophy and fibrosis in H9c2 cells in vitro and in adult zebrafish heart in vivo as model system to study Adriamycin induced cardiotoxicity. Paeonol activated Notch1 signaling and expression of its downstream target genes effectively in the Adriamycin treated condition invitro and in vivo. Also we detected that Notch activation using Paeonol protected the cells from apoptosis, collagen deposition and hypertrophy response using functional assays. We conclude that Adriamycin induced cardiotoxicity by promoting the pathological cardiac remodeling through inhibition of Notch1 signaling and that the Notch1 reactivation by Paeonol protected the cells and reversed the cardiotoxicity.

31311324|t|NEAT1 is overexpressed in Parkinson's disease substantia nigra and confers drug-inducible neuroprotection from oxidative stress.
31311324|a|Recent reports attribute numerous regulatory functions to the nuclear paraspeckle-forming long noncoding RNA, nuclear enriched assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1), but the implications of its involvement in Parkinson's disease (PD) remain controversial. To address this issue, we assessed NEAT1 expression levels and cell type patterns in the substantia nigra (SN) from 53 donors with and without PD, as well as in interference tissue culture tests followed by multiple in-house and web-available models of PD. PCR quantification identified elevated levels of NEAT1 expression in the PD SN compared with control brains, an elevation that was reproducible across a multitude of disease models. In situ RNA hybridization supported neuron-specific formation of NEAT1-based paraspeckles at the SN and demonstrated coincreases of NEAT1 and paraspeckles in cultured cells under paraquat (PQ)-induced oxidative stress. Furthermore, neuroprotective agents, including fenofibrate and simvastatin, induced NEAT1 up-regulation, whereas RNA interference-mediated depletion of NEAT1 exacerbated death of PQ-exposed cells in a leucine-rich repeat kinase 2-mediated manner. Our findings highlight a novel protective role for NEAT1 in PD and suggest a previously unknown mechanism for the neuroprotective traits of widely used preventive therapeutics.-Simchovitz, A., Hanan, M., Niederhoffer, N., Madrer, N., Yayon, N., Bennett, E. R., Greenberg, D. S., Kadener, S., Soreq, H. NEAT1 is overexpressed in Parkinson's disease substantia nigra and confers drug-inducible neuroprotection from oxidative stress.

31324879|t|Bone morphogenetic protein 2 is a depot-specific regulator of human adipogenesis.
31324879|a|BACKGROUND: Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) regulate adipogenesis but it is not clear whether they influence regional adipose tissue (AT) development in humans. OBJECTIVE: To characterise BMP2 expression, BMP2-SMAD1/5/8 signalling, and BMP2's potential effect on proliferation and adipogenesis in human subcutaneous abdominal and gluteal AT and its constituent preadipocytes. METHODS: BMP2 expression was measured in whole AT and immortalised preadipocytes via qPCR and Western blot; secreted/circulating BMP2 was measured by ELISA. The effect of BMP2 on preadipocyte proliferation was evaluated using a fluorescent assay. BMP2's effect on adipogenesis in immortalised preadipocytes was determined via qPCR of adipogenic markers and cellular triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation. BMP2-SMAD1/5/8 signalling was assessed in immortalised preadipocytes via Western blot and qPCR of ID1 expression. RESULTS: BMP2 was expressed and released by abdominal and gluteal AT and preadipocytes. Exogenous BMP2 dose dependently promoted adipogenesis in abdominal preadipocytes only; 50 ng/ml BMP2 increased PPARG2 expression (10-fold compared to vehicle, p &lt; 0.001) and TAG accumulation (3-fold compared to vehicle; p &lt; 0.001). BMP2 stimulated SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation and ID1 expression in abdominal and gluteal preadipocytes but this was blocked by 500 nM K02288, a type 1 BMP receptor inhibitor (p &lt; 0.001). Co-administration of 500 nM K02288 also inhibited the pro-adipogenic effect of 50 ng/ml BMP2 in abdominal cells; &gt;90% inhibition of TAG accumulation (p &lt; 0.001) and ~50% inhibition of PPARG2 expression (p &lt; 0.001). The endogenous iron regulator erythroferrone reduced BMP2-SMAD1/5/8 signalling by ~30% specifically in subcutaneous abdominal preadipocytes (p &lt; 0.01), suggesting it plays a role in restricting the expansion of the body's largest AT depot during energy deficiency. Additionally, a waist-hip ratio-increasing common polymorphism near BMP2 is an eQTL associated with ~15% lower BMP2 expression in abdominal and gluteal AT (p &lt; 0.05) as well as altered adipocyte size in male abdominal AT (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data implicate BMP2-SMAD1/5/8 signalling in depot-specific preadipocyte development and abdominal AT expansion in humans.

31325559|t|Evidence that melatonin downregulates Nedd4-1 E3 ligase and its role in cellular survival.
31325559|a|Indolamine melatonin structurally resembles non-covalent proteasome inhibitors; however, the role of ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) in neuronal survival and how melatonin carries out UPS inhibition remain largely unknown. With the use of melatonin treated cells, we evaluated the expression of Nedd4-1, an E3 ligase, how melatonin regulates its activity and its relationship with neuronal survival. Nedd4-1 was upregulated in the hypoxic condition in both control and Nedd4-1 overexpressed cells and melatonin treatment reversed its expression in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions, which was associated with increased cellular survival. Melatonin had no effect on the expression of Nedd4-1 at mRNA level. However, when melatonin was administered along with protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, protein level of Nedd4-1 was further reduced, indicating that melatonin possibly downregulates Nedd4-1 after its synthesis. Notably, co-immunoprecipitation analyses followed by Liquid chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) revealed that melatonin may dissociate ribosomal proteins, such as RS19, RL23A, and nucleophosmin from Nedd4-1, while 40S ribosomal protein S7 and 60S ribosomal protein L35 came into contact with Nedd4-1 upon melatonin treatment. By using IPA analyses, we obtained further data indicated novel target molecules of melatonin in hypoxic conditions, including OTOF, SF3B2, IPO5, ST13, FGFR3, Mx1/Mx2, playing roles in RNA splicing and trafficking, growth factor and interferon signaling. Here, we described a new insight into the role of melatonin in UPS functioning by proposing a molecular mechanism through which melatonin regulates Nedd4-1.

31326506|t|Cannabidiol improves behavioural and neurochemical deficits in adult female offspring of the maternal immune activation (poly I:C) model of neurodevelopmental disorders.
31326506|a|Cognitive impairment is a major source of disability in schizophrenia and current antipsychotic drugs (APDs) have minimal efficacy for this symptom domain. Cannabidiol (CBD), the major non-intoxicating component of Cannabis sativa L., exhibits antipsychotic and neuroprotective properties. We recently reported the effects of CBD on cognition in male offspring of a maternal immune activation (polyinosinic-polycytidilic acid (poly I:C)) model relevant to the aetiology of schizophrenia; however, the effects of CBD treatment in females are unknown. Sex differences are observed in the onset of schizophrenia symptoms and response to APD treatment. Furthermore, the endogenous cannabinoid system, a direct target of CBD, is sexually dimorphic in humans and rodents. Therefore, the present work aimed to assess the therapeutic impact of CBD treatment on behaviour and neurochemical signalling markers in female poly I:C offspring. Time-mated pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 16) were administered poly I:C (4 mg/kg; i.v.) or saline (control) on gestational day 15. From postnatal day 56, female offspring received CBD (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle treatment for approximately 3 weeks. Following 2 weeks of CBD treatment, offspring underwent behavioural testing, including the novel object recognition, rewarded alternation T-maze and social interaction tests to assess recognition memory, working memory and sociability, respectively. After 3 weeks of CBD treatment, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC) were collected to assess effects on endocannabinoid, glutamatergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signalling markers. CBD attenuated poly I:C-induced deficits in recognition memory, social interaction and glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) binding in the PFC of poly I:C offspring. Working memory performance was similar between treatment groups. CBD also increased glutamate decarboxylase 67, the rate-limiting enzyme that converts glutamate to GABA, and parvalbumin protein levels in the HPC. In contrast to the CBD treatment effects observed in poly I:C offspring, CBD administration to control rats reduced social interaction, cannabinoid CB1 receptor and NMDAR binding density in the PFC, suggesting that CBD administration to healthy rats may have negative consequences on social behaviour and brain maturation in adulthood. Overall, the findings of this study support the therapeutic benefits of CBD on recognition memory and sociability in female poly I:C offspring, and provide insight into the neurochemical changes that may underlie the therapeutic benefits of CBD in the poly I:C model.

31332904|t|Quercetin protected against isoniazide-induced HepG2 cell apoptosis by activating the SIRT1/ERK pathway.
31332904|a|Isoniazid (INH) is one of the most commonly used antituberculosis drugs, but its clinical applications have been limited by severe hepatic toxicity. Quercetin (Que), a natural flavonoid, has been proved to have many medicinal properties. This study aimed to clarify the possible protective effects of Que against INH-induced hepatotoxicity using HepG2 cells. Our results indicated that Que significantly increased cell viability, superoxide dismutase, and GSH levels, while decreased alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase levels. Besides, Que significantly abrogated INH-induced cell apoptosis by upregulating the expression levels of Bcl-2 and decreasing the levels of Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved caspase-9. Furthermore, Que obviously reversed the inhibition of INH on Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) expression and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. Next, the SIRT1 inhibitor EX527 blocked the enhancement of Que upon ERK phosphorylation. Notably, EX527 partially abolished the beneficial effects of Que. In brief, our results provided the first evidence that Que protected against INH-induced HepG2 cells by regulating the SIRT1/ERK pathway.

31336132|t|Thyroid hormone-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines interfere with resveratrol-induced anti-proliferation of oral cancer cells.
31336132|a|Thyroid hormone, L-thyroxine (T4), induces inflammatory genes expressions and promotes cancer growth. It also induces expression of the checkpoint programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), which plays a vital role in cancer progression. On the other hand, resveratrol inhibits inflammatory genes expressions. Moreover, resveratrol increases nuclear inducible cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 accumulation, complexes with p53, and induces p53-dependent anti-proliferation. In this study, we investigated the effect of T4 on resveratrol-induced anti-proliferation in oral cancer. T4 increased the expression and cytoplasmic accumulation of PD-L1. Increased expressions of pro-inflammatory genes, interleukin (IL)-1beta and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, were shown to stimulate PD-L1 expression. T4 stimulated pro-inflammatory and proliferative genes expressions, and oral cancer cells proliferation. In contrast, resveratrol inhibited those genes and activated anti-proliferative genes. T4 retained resveratrol-induced COX-2 in cytoplasm and prevented COX-2 nuclear accumulation when resveratrol treated cancer cells. A specific signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) inhibitor, S31-201, blocked T4-induced inhibition and restored resveratrol-induced nuclear COX-2 accumulation. By inhibiting the T4-activated STAT3 signal transduction axis with S31-201, resveratrol was able to sequentially reestablish COX-2/p53-dependent gene expressions and anti-proliferation. These findings provide a novel understanding of the inhibitory effects of T4 on resveratrol-induced anticancer properties via the sequential expression of PD-L1 and inflammatory genes.

31339859|t|Effect of bisphenol-A (BPA) on placental biomarkers for inflammation, neurodevelopment and oxidative stress.
31339859|a|Background Bisphenol-A (BPA) is a widespread pollutant whose effects on pregnant women are poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the effects of BPA on basal and bacteria-stimulated production of proinflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and IL-6], anti-inflammatory mediators [soluble glycoprotein 130 (sgp) 130, heme oxidase-1 (HO-1) and IL-10] and biomarkers for neurodevelopment [brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)], and oxidative stress [8-isoprostane (8-IsoP)] by the placenta. Methods Placental explant cultures were treated with BPA (0-10,000 nM) in the presence or absence of 107 colony-forming unit (CFU)/mL heat-killed Escherichia coli for 24 h. Biomarker concentrations in conditioned medium were quantified by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results Under basal conditions, IL-1beta and IL-6 production was enhanced by BPA in a dose-dependent manner. Sgp130, a soluble receptor that reduces IL-6 bioactivity, was suppressed by BPA at 1000-10,000 nM. BPA also enhanced BDNF production at 1000 and 10,000 nM, and 8-IsoP expression at 10 and 100 nM. For bacteria-treated cultures, BPA increased IL-6 production at 100 nM and reduced sgp130 at 1000 nM but had no effect on IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, BDNF, HO-1, 8-IsoP or IL-10 production. Conclusion BPA may increase placental inflammation by promoting IL-1beta and IL-6 but inhibiting sgp130. It may also disrupt oxidative balance and neurodevelopment by increasing 8-IsoP and BDNF production.

31344369|t|Long-term exposure to bisphenol A or S promotes glucose intolerance and changes hepatic mitochondrial metabolism in male Wistar rats.
31344369|a|The present study evaluates the effects of low-level long-term exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) and bisphenol S (BPS) on serum biochemical markers, glucose homeostasis, mitochondrial energy metabolism, biogenesis and dynamics, and redox status in livers of Wistar rats. While only the exposure to BPS induces a significant body mass gain after 21 weeks, both compounds alter serum lipid levels and lead to the development of glucose intolerance. Regarding mitochondrial metabolism, both bisphenols augment the electron entry by complex II relative to complex I in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC), and reduce mitochondrial content; BPA reduces OXPHOS capacity and uncouples respiration (relative to maximal capacity of MRC) but promotes a significant increase in fatty acid oxidation. Either exposure to BPA or BPS leads to an increase in mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species, mainly at complex I. Additionally, BPA and BPS significantly upregulate the expression levels of dynamin-related protein 1 related to mitochondrial fission, while BPA downregulates the expression of proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. In summary, our data shows that exposure to both compounds alters metabolic homeostasis and mitochondrial energy metabolism, providing new mechanisms by which BPA and BPS impair the mitochondrial metabolism.

31351049|t|Knockdown of TRIM28 inhibits PDGF-BB-induced vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration.
31351049|a|Atherosclerosis is a common type of cardiovascular disease (CVD), remaining one of the leading causes of global death. Tripartite motif-containing 28 (TRIM28) is a member of TRIM family that has been found to be involved in atherosclerosis. However, the role of TRIM28 in atherosclerosis remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effects of TRIM28 on the phenotypic switching of human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs), which is considered as a fundamental event during the development of atherosclerosis. The results showed that TRIM28 was highly expressed in human atherosclerotic tissues, as well in cultured HASMCs stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor subunit B homodimer (PDGF-BB). Knockdown of TRIM28 by transfection with siRNA targeting TRIM28 (si-TRIM28) significantly suppressed the PDGF-BB-induced cell proliferation and migration of HASMCs. Besides, knockdown of TRIM28 inhibited the expressions of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9. The VSMC markers including alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), calponin and SM22alpha were upregulated in TRIM28 knocked down HASMCs. Furthermore, knockdown of TRIM28 blocked PDGF-BB-induced NF-kappaB activation in HASMCs. Collectively, knockdown of TRIM28 prevented PDGF-BB-induced phenotypic switching of HASMCs, which might be mediated by the regulation of NF-kappaB signaling pathway.

31352099|t|Co-exposure to ketoconazole alters effects of bisphenol A in Danio rerio and H295R cells.
31352099|a|Chemicals are present in combination in ambient water, however toxicities of their mixtures are not well understood. This study investigated the effects of ketoconazole (KCZ) on the responses induced by bisphenol A (BPA) in zebrafish and in human adrenocarcinoma (H295R) cells. After exposure to BPA alone or mixed with KCZ for 21 d, egg production, relative tissue weights, sex hormone levels, cytochrome P450 (CYP)3a activity, and transcriptions of genes related to CYP metabolism, vitellogenesis, and steroidogenesis were determined in zebrafish. Male fish were more sensitive to the adverse effects of BPA than females, and the presence of KCZ potentiated the BPA-induced estrogenic responses in the male and anti-estrogenic responses in the female fish. In male zebrafish exposed to BPA, a significant reduction in egg number and relative gonad weight, an increase in 17beta-estradiol (E2) to testosterone (T) ratio, and an upregulation of vtg, eralpha, and cyp19a genes were observed. Under KCZ, BPA exposure resulted in a significant downregulation of cyp3a65 and pxr genes and an increase in estrogenic responses in males. In female fish, anti-estrogenic effects, such as a decrease in E2 concentration, were observed following the combined exposure. These results indicate that KCZ could increase the toxicity of the chemicals that depend on the given CYP metabolism for their elimination or other crucial functions such as steroidogenesis. Co-exposure to BPA and KCZ in H295R cells also increased E2 and decreased T production. Release and presence of this azole compound warrant caution, because it could modify adverse effects of BPA.

31364238|t|Neonicotinoid pesticides poorly interact with human drug transporters.
31364238|a|The interactions of six neonicotinoid pesticides and one neonicotinoid metabolite with drug transporters have been characterized in vitro. Acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, nitenpyram, thiacloprid and its metabolite thiacloprid amide, and thiamethoxam, each used at 100 microM, did not impair activity of the efflux pumps P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance-associated proteins, and breast cancer resistance protein. They also did not inhibit that of the uptake transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT4, and MATE1, whereas that of OATP2B1, OAT1, and MATE2-K was affected by only one of the seven neonicotinoids. Activity of OCT1 was moderately stimulated (up to 1.5-fold) by several neonicotinoids. By contrast, that of OAT3 and OCT2 was inhibited by most (OAT3), if not all (OCT2), neonicotinoids, with IC50 values in the 20 to 60 microM range for thiacloprid, likely not relevant to environmental exposure. Thiacloprid was moreover not transported by OAT3 and OCT2. Overall, these data suggest that neonicotinoid pesticides rather poorly interact with drug transporter activities.

31368501|t|mRNA-Sequencing Identifies Liver as a Potential Target Organ for Triphenyl Phosphate in Embryonic Zebrafish.
31368501|a|Triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) is a commonly used organophosphate flame retardant and plasticizer in the United States. Using zebrafish as a model, the overall objective of this study was to identify potential organs that might be targeted by TPHP during embryonic development. Based on mRNA-sequencing, TPHP exposure from 24 to 30 h post fertilization (hpf) and 24 to 48 hpf significantly affected the abundance of 305 and 274 transcripts, respectively, relative to vehicle (0.1% DMSO) controls. In addition to minor effects on cardiotoxicity- and nephrotoxicity-related pathways, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of significantly affected transcripts within 30- and 48-hpf embryos revealed that hepatotoxicity-related pathways were strongly affected following exposure to TPHP alone. Moreover, while pre-treatment with fenretinide (a retinoic acid receptor agonist) mitigated TPHP-induced pericardial edema and liver enlargement at 72 hpf and 128 hpf, respectively, IPA revealed that fenretinide was unable to block TPHP-induced effects on cardiotoxicity-, nephrotoxicity-, and hepatotoxicity-related pathways at 48 hpf, suggesting that TPHP-induced effects on the transcriptome were not associated with toxicity later in development. In addition, based on Oil Red O staining, we found that exposure to TPHP nearly abolished neutral lipids from the embryonic head and trunk and, based on metabolomics, significantly decreased the total abundance of metabolites - including betaine, a known osmoprotectant - at 48 and 72 hpf. Overall, our data suggest that, in addition to the heart, TPHP exposure during early development results in adverse effects on the liver, lipid utilization, and osmoregulation within embryonic zebrafish.

31368508|t|Cannabichromene is a cannabinoid CB2 receptor agonist.
31368508|a|BACKGROUND: Cannabichromene (CBC) is one of the most abundant phytocannabinoids in Cannabis spp. It has modest anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects and potentiates some effects of Delta9 - tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in vivo. How CBC exerts these effects is poorly defined and there is little information about its efficacy at cannabinoid receptors. We sought to determine the functional activity of CBC at CB1 and CB2 receptors. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: AtT20 cells stably expressing HA-tagged human CB1 and CB2 receptors were used. Assays of cellular membrane potential and loss of cell surface receptors were performed. KEY RESULTS: CBC activated CB2 but not CB1 receptors to produce a hyperpolarization of AtT20 cells. This activation was inhibited by a CB2 antagonist AM630, and sensitive to pertussis toxin. Application of CBC reduced activation of CB2 receptors (but not CB1 receptors) by subsequent co-application of CP55,940, an efficacious CB1 and CB2 agonist. Continuous CBC application induced loss of cell surface CB2 receptors and desensitisation of the CB2-induced hyperpolarization. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: CBC is a selective CB2 receptor agonist displaying higher efficacy than THC in hyperpolarising AtT20 cells. CBC can also recruit CB2 receptor regulatory mechanisms. CBC may contribute to the potential therapeutic effectiveness of some cannabis preparations, potentially through CB2-mediated modulation of inflammation.

31369848|t|Glucose-regulated protein 75 in foodborne disease models induces renal tubular necrosis.
31369848|a|The incidence of kidney disease has increased rapidly in recent years. One major possible reason for this increase in nephrosis is from foodborne toxins. Since the mechanism of how foodborne toxins are involved in the process of nephrosis is largely unknown, the current study aims to establish a profile for how one of the major toxin threats, ochratoxin A (OTA), induce differential protein expression. In this proteomic study of rat kidneys, 75 kd glucose-regulated protein (Grp75) expression was found to be sensitized by a low concentration of OTA, but inhibited by high doses. In response to OTA, a decrease in Grp75 expression preceded the inhibition of mitochondrial Lon peptidase 1 (Lonp1). Using Grp75 knockdown cell line, it was shown that the inhibition of Grp75 promoted the secretion of kidney injury molecule 1 (Kim1), and suppressed Lonp1 expression in renal injury. Moreover, the acceleration of renal disease was associated with the consumption of Grp75. Our study suggests that the Grp75 protein may be valuable as both a treatment and biomarker for the foodborne diseases that induce renal tubular necrosis. The findings of this research are beneficial for the establishment of nutritional interventions, and the screening of therapeutic targets, in cases of nephrosis.

31374489|t|Effects of chronic glyphosate exposure to pregnant mice on hepatic lipid metabolism in offspring.
31374489|a|Glyphosate is the active ingredient in Roundup, one of the most popular herbicides in the world, and its toxicity has caused increasing concerns. The present study aims to investigate the toxic effects of prenatal exposure to pure glyphosate or Roundup on lipid metabolism in offspring. During gestational days (GDs), ICR mice (from Institute of Cancer Research) were given distilled water, 0.5% glyphosate solution (w/v, 0.5 g/100 ml) or 0.5%-glyphosate Roundup solution orally. The livers and serum samples of the offspring were collected on gestational day 19 (GD19), postnatal day 7 (PND7) and PND21. The results showed a significant decrease in the body weight and obvious hepatic steatosis with excessive lipid droplet formation in offspring. Moreover, the concentrations of lipids such as triglycerides (TGs), total cholesterol (T-CHO), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterols (LDL-C) increased to a significant extent in both the serum and livers. Furthermore, there were significant differences in the expression levels of the genes SREBP1C, SREBP2, Fasn, Hmgcr, Hmgcs and PPARalpha, which are related to lipid biosynthesis or catabolism in the liver. These results demonstrate that chronic prenatal exposure to glyphosate can result in lipid metabolism disruption in the offspring of mice, as glyphosate exerts a negative influence on the expression of lipogenesis genes.

31378764|t|Disulfiram facilitates ataxin-3 nuclear translocation and potentiates the cytotoxicity in a cell model of SCA3.
31378764|a|Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is caused by the expansion of a glutamine-encoding CAG repeat in the ATXN3 gene encoding the protein ataxin-3. The nuclear presence of polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-3 is of critical importance for the pathogenesis of SCA3. Disulfiram, an FDA-approved drug for alcoholism, has also garnered attention in cancer treatment. However, it has shown toxicity in the nervous system. Bearing this in mind, we treated cells expressing ataxin-3 with disulfiram to measure several pathogenic cascades of SCA3, including aggregate formation, soluble ataxin-3 expression and nuclear localization of ataxin-3 and the cytotoxicity, which assess the direct effect of disulfiram on SCA3 cell models. To our knowledge, this is direct evidence that disulfiram elevated the nuclear localization of polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-3 and enhanced the cytotoxicity in a cell model of SCA3. Furthermore, disulfiram did not affect the aggregate formation of polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-3 at least at a single dose. Our findings repurpose disulfiram as a modulator of ataxin-3 nuclear transport that aggravates the pathology of SCA3, which is a new target for disulfiram. This study also represents an important example of determining novel side effects in pre-existing drugs. This study suggests that caution may be warranted when this compound is used to treat alcohol abuse or cancer in patients carrying a SCA3-causing mutation.

31385236|t|Superoxide-hydrogen peroxide imbalance differentially modulates the keratinocytes cell line (HaCaT) oxidative metabolism via Keap1-Nrf2 redox signaling pathway.
31385236|a|The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a superoxide-hydrogen peroxide (S-HP) imbalance of the superoxide dismutase manganese dependent (SOD2) gene, generated by paraquat and porphyrin exposure, on the keratinocytes cell line (HaCaT) oxidative metabolism. Paraquat acts increasing superoxide (O 2  - ) levels, while porphyrin increases hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels, acting as VV-SOD2-like and AA-SOD2-like molecules, respectively. First of all, HaCAT cells were treated with different concentrations of paraquat and porphyrin (1; 10; 30, and 70 muM) to determine the concentration of both that causes imbalance. After defining the concentration of paraquat and porphyrin (70 muM), a time curve was performed (1, 3, 6, and 24 h) to evaluate ROS production levels. Other oxidative parameters, such as nitric oxide (NO), lipoperoxidation (TBARS) and protein carbonyl, were evaluated after 24 h of incubation, as well as genotoxic analyses, apoptosis detection, and gene expression. Our findings revealed that paraquat exposure decreased cell viability, increasing lipoperoxidation, DNA damage, and apoptosis. On the other hand, porphyrin treatment increased cell viability and proliferation, ROS and NO production, triggering protein and DNA damage. In addition, porphyrin up-regulated Keap1 and Nrf2 gene expression, while paraquat decreased Nrf2 gene expression. In this sense, we suggested that the superoxide-hydrogen peroxide imbalance differentially modulates oxidative stress on keratinocytes cell line via Keap1-Nrf2 gene expression pathway.

31388677|t|p53 activation by Cr(VI): a transcriptionally limited response induced by ATR kinase in S-phase.
31388677|a|Cellular reduction of carcinogenic chromium(VI) causes several forms of Cr-DNA damage with different genotoxic properties. Chromate-treated cultured cells have shown a strong proapoptotic activity of the DNA damage-sensitive transcription factor p53. However, induction of p53 transcriptional targets by Cr(VI) in rodent lungs was weak or undetectable. We examined Cr(VI) effects on the p53 pathway in human cells with restored levels of ascorbate that acts as a principal reducer of Cr(VI) in vivo but is nearly absent in standard cell cultures. Ascorbate-restored H460 and primary human cells treated with Cr(VI) contained higher levels of p53 and its Ser15 phosphorylation, which were induced by ATR kinase. Cr(VI)-stimulated p53 phosphorylation occurred in S-phase by a diffusible pool of ATR that was separate from the chromatin-bound pool targeting DNA repair substrates at the sites of toxic mismatch repair of Cr-DNA adducts. Even when more abundantly present than after exposure to the radiomimetic bleomycin, Cr(VI)-stabilized p53 showed a much more limited activation of its target genes in two types of primary human cells. No increases in mRNA were found for nucleotide excision repair factors and a majority of proapoptotic genes. A weak transcription activity of Cr(VI)-upregulated p53 was associated with its low lysine acetylation in the regulatory C-terminal domain, resulting from the inability of Cr(VI) to activate ATM in ascorbate-restored cells. Thus, p53 activation by ascorbate-metabolized Cr(VI) represents a limited genome-protective response that is defective in upregulation of DNA repair genes and proapoptotic transcripts for elimination of damaged cells.

31391268|t|TMPRSS2 is the major activating protease of influenza A virus in primary human airway cells and influenza B virus in human type II pneumocytes.
31391268|a|Cleavage of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) by host cell proteases is essential for virus infectivity and spread. We previously demonstrated in vitro that the transmembrane protease TMPRSS2 cleaves influenza A and B virus (IAV/IBV) HA possessing a monobasic cleavage site. Subsequent studies revealed that TMPRSS2 is crucial for activation and pathogenesis of H1N1pdm and H7N9 IAV in mice. In contrast, activation of H3N2 IAV and IBV was found to be independent of TMPRSS2 expression and supported by as-yet undetermined protease(s).Here, we investigated the role of TMPRSS2 in proteolytic activation of IAV and IBV in three human airway cell culture systems: primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC), primary type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECII) and Calu-3 cells. Knockdown of TMPRSS2 expression was performed using a previously described antisense peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer, T-ex5, that interferes with splicing of TMPRSS2 pre-mRNA, resulting in the expression of enzymatically inactive TMPRSS2. T-ex5 treatment produced efficient knockdown of active TMPRSS2 in all three airway cell culture models and prevented proteolytic activation and multiplication of H7N9 IAV in Calu-3 cells and H1N1pdm, H7N9 and H3N2 IAV in HBEC and AECII. T-ex5 treatment also inhibited activation and spread of IBV in AECII, but did not affect IBV activation in HBEC and Calu-3 cells. This study identifies TMPRSS2 as the major HA-activating protease of IAV in human airway cells and IBV in type II pneumocytes and as a potential target for the development of novel drugs to treat influenza infections.ImportanceInfluenza A and B viruses (IAV/IBV) cause significant morbidity and mortality during seasonal outbreaks. Cleavage of the viral surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) by host proteases is a prerequisite for membrane fusion and essential for virus infectivity. Inhibition of relevant proteases provides a promising therapeutic approach that may avoid the development of drug resistance. HA of most influenza viruses is cleaved at a monobasic cleavage site and a number of proteases have been shown to cleave HA in vitro This study demonstrates that the transmembrane protease TMPRSS2 is the major HA-activating protease of IAV in primary human bronchial cells and of both IAV and IBV in primary human type II pneumocytes. It further reveals that human and murine airway cells can differ in their HA-cleaving protease repertoire. Our data will help drive the development of potent and selective protease inhibitors as novel drugs for influenza treatment.

31393584|t|Increased bone marrow-specific adipogenesis by clofazimine causes impaired fracture healing, osteopenia and osteonecrosis without extra-skeletal effects in rats.
31393584|a|Mycobacterium leprae infection causes bone lesions and osteoporosis, however, the effect of anti-leprosy drugs on the bone is unknown. We, therefore, set out to address it by investigating osteogenic differentiation from bone marrow (BM)-derived mesenchyme stem cells (MSCs). Out of seven anti-leprosy drugs, only clofazimine (CFZ) reduced MSCs viability (IC50 ~1muM) and their osteogenic differentiation but increased adipogenic differentiation on a par with rosiglitazone, and this effect was blocked by a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) antagonist, GW9662. CFZ also decreased osteoblast viability and resulted in impaired bone regeneration in a rat femur osteotomy model at 1/3rd human drug dose owing to increased callus adipogenesis as GW9662 prevented this effect. CFZ treatment decreased BM-MSCs population and homing of MSCs to osteotomy site despite drug levels in BM being much less than it's in vitro IC50 value. In adult rats, CFZ caused osteopenia in long bones marked by suppressed osteoblast function due to enhanced adipogenesis and increased osteoclast functions. A robust increase in marrow adipose tissue (MAT) by CFZ did not alter hematologic parameters but likely reduced BM vascular bed leading to osteonecrosis (ON) characterized by empty osteocyte lacunae. However, CFZ had no effect on visceral fat content and was not associated with any metabolic and hematologic changes. Levels of unsaturated fatty acids in MAT were higher than saturated fatty acids and CFZ further increased the former. From these data, we conclude that CFZ has skeletal toxicity and could be used for creating a rodent ON model devoid of extra-skeletal effects.

31394953|t|Anti-inflammatory activity of argan oil and its minor components.
31394953|a|Argan oil is thought to be the most expensive edible oil worldwide. It is difficult to produce and the argan tree only grows in a limited geographical area, notably Morocco and Algeria. Because it is produced by mechanical means, argan oil contains "minor" components that might be endowed with healthful effects. We investigated in vivo the anti-inflammatory activities of argan oil and its unsaponifiable fraction, using diclofenac as the control, in a carrageenan-induced rat model of inflammation. Rats were given different amounts of argan oil or its unsaponifiable fraction, by gavage. We report that argan oil and its "minor" components effectively lessen the inflammatory actions of carrageenan. Far from being "pharmacological" the actions of argan oil are comparable with those of diclofenac in the short, i.e. 4 h term. Sustained consumption of argan oil might, therefore, contribute to lessen the burden of degenerative diseases associated with higher inflammatory status.

31406347|t|Mutations in RABL3 alter KRAS prenylation and are associated with hereditary pancreatic cancer.
31406347|a|Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is an aggressive cancer with limited treatment options1. Approximately 10% of cases exhibit familial predisposition, but causative genes are not known in most families2. We perform whole-genome sequence analysis in a family with multiple cases of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and identify a germline truncating mutation in the member of the RAS oncogene family-like 3 (RABL3) gene. Heterozygous rabl3 mutant zebrafish show increased susceptibility to cancer formation. Transcriptomic and mass spectrometry approaches implicate RABL3 in RAS pathway regulation and identify an interaction with RAP1GDS1 (SmgGDS), a chaperone regulating prenylation of RAS GTPases3. Indeed, the truncated mutant RABL3 protein accelerates KRAS prenylation and requires RAS proteins to promote cell proliferation. Finally, evidence in patient cohorts with developmental disorders implicates germline RABL3 mutations in RASopathy syndromes. Our studies identify RABL3 mutations as a target for genetic testing in cancer families and uncover a mechanism for dysregulated RAS activity in development and cancer.

31408636|t|Survey of drug therapies against acute oral tetramethylenedisulfotetramine poisoning in a rat voluntary consumption model.
31408636|a|Ingestion of the noncompetitive GABAA receptor antagonist tetramethylenedisulfotetramine (TETS) results in arrhythmias, respiratory depression, and life-threatening convulsive status epilepticus. We have previously developed a realistic model of voluntary TETS consumption, in which rats promptly consumed a piece of cereal containing a dose of TETS that led to rapid progression of toxic signs (including convulsions) and profound and enduring behavioral suppression. Recently, this model was used to survey nine different drugs from distinct drug classes over a large range of doses to identify possible therapeutics. The drugs included three benzodiazepines (diazepam, midazolam, and lorazepam), two barbiturates (phenobarbital and pentobarbital), the GABAA allosteric modulator allopregnanolone, and three non-traditional therapeutics (dexmedetomidine, ketamine, and ethanol). Treatment was administered intraperitoneally 10 min after consumption of the cereal morsel containing TETS (600 mug/kg). This exposure model resulted in a survival rate of 30% in vehicle-treated rats. Diazepam (12.5 mg/kg) and midazolam (25 mg/kg), compared to vehicle, significantly increased survival (75 and 100% respectively) but at only one of the three doses tested. Lorazepam increased survival across a wide range of doses (1.56-25 mg/kg) with survival rates between 80-100%. Phenobarbital (100 mg/kg) was the only other drug and non-benzodiazepine to improve survival rates (80%). Although the four aforementioned therapeutics increased survival, TETS-induced weight loss, food wastage, and behavioral deficits remained in survivors.

31412289|t|Discovery of Keap1-Nrf2 small-molecule inhibitors from phytochemicals based on molecular docking.
31412289|a|Various phytochemicals have been reported to protect against oxidative stress. However, the mechanism underlying has not been systematically evaluated, which limited their application in disease treatment. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a central transcription factor in oxidative stress response related to numerous diseases, is activated after dissociating from the cytoskeleton-anchored Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). The Keap1-Nrf2 protein-protein interaction has become an important drug target. This study was designed to clarify whether antioxidantive phytochemicals inhibit the Keap1-Nrf2 protein-protein interaction and activate the Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway efficiently. Molecular docking and 3D-QSAR were applied to evaluate the interaction effects between 178 antioxidant phytochemicals and the Nrf2 binding site in Keap1. The Nrf2 activation effect was tested on a H2O2-induced oxidative-injured cell model. Results showed that the 178 phytochemicals could be divided into high-, medium-, and low-total-score groups depending on their binding affinity with Keap1, and the high-total-score group consisted of 24 compounds with abundant oxygen or glycosides. Meanwhile, these compounds could bind with key amino acids in the structure of the Keap1-Nrf2 interface. Compounds from high-total-score group show effective activation effects on Nrf2. In conclusion, phytochemicals showed high binding affinity with Keap1 are promising new Nrf2 activators.

31419397|t|Citreoviridin induces myocardial apoptosis through PPAR-gamma-mTORC2-mediated autophagic pathway and the protective effect of thiamine and selenium.
31419397|a|Citreoviridin (CIT), a mycotoxin and ATP synthase inhibitor, is regarded as one of aetiology factors of cardiac beriberi and Keshan disease. Thiamine (VB1) and selenium (Se) improve the recovery of these two diseases respectively. The underlying mechanisms of cardiotoxic effect of CIT and cardioprotective effect of VB1 and Se have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we found that ectopic ATP synthase was more sensitive to CIT treatment than mitochondrial ATP synthase in H9c2 cardiomyocytes. CIT inhibited the transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) in mice hearts and H9c2 cells. PPAR-gamma agonist attenuated the inhibitory effect of CIT on mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) and stimulatory effect of CIT on autophagy in cardiomyocytes. CIT induced apoptosis through lysosomal-mitochondrial axis in cardiomyocytes. PPAR-gamma agonist and autophagy inhibitor alleviated CIT-induced apoptosis and accelerated cardiac biomarker. VB1 and Se accelerated the basal transcriptional activity of PPAR-gamma in mice hearts and H9c2 cells. Furthermore, VB1 and Se reversed the effect of CIT on PPAR-gamma, autophagy and apoptosis. Our findings defined PPAR-gamma-mTORC2-autophagy pathway as the key link between CIT cardiotoxicity and cardioprotective effect of VB1 and Se. The present study would shed new light on the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy and the cardioprotective mechanism of micronutrients.

31419471|t|Pubertal exposure to low doses of zearalenone disrupting spermatogenesis through ERalpha related genetic and epigenetic pathways.
31419471|a|Endocrine disruptor zearalenone (ZEA) has been found to damage the reproductive system especially spermatogenesis. In our previous report, we have found that low dose (lower than No-Observed Effect Level, NOEL) ZEA exposure disturbed mouse spermatogenesis and diminished mouse semen quality. The purpose of current investigation was to explore the underlying mechanisms of pubertal low dose ZEA exposure upsetting spermatogenesis. And it was demonstrated that pubertal low dose ZEA exposure disrupted the meiosis process and the important genetic pathways to inhibit the spermatogenesis and even to diminish the semen quality with the decrease in spermatozoa motility and concentration. The DNA methylation markers 5mC and 5hmC were decreased, the histone methylation marker H3K27 was increased, at the same time estrogen receptor alpha was diminished in mouse testis after pubertal low dose ZEA exposure. The data indicate that the disruption in spermatogenesis by pubertal low dose ZEA exposure may be through the alterations in genetic and epigenetic pathways, and the interactions with estrogen receptor signaling pathway. Therefore, we should pay great attention on ZEA exposure to reduce its adverse impacts on male reproductive health.

31422080|t|Protein kinase Cdelta mediates methamphetamine-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity in mice via activation of microsomal epoxide hydrolase.
31422080|a|We previously demonstrated that activation of protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta) is critical for methamphetamine (MA)-induced dopaminergic toxicity. It was recognized that microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) also induces dopaminergic neurotoxicity. It was demonstrated that inhibition of PKC modulates the expression of mEH. We investigated whether MA-induced PKCdelta activation requires mEH induction in mice. MA treatment (8 mg/kg, i.p., x 4; 2 h interval) significantly enhanced the level of phosphorylated PKCdelta in the striatum of wild type (WT) mice. Subsequently, treatment with MA resulted in significant increases in the expression of cleaved PKCdelta and mEH. Treatment with MA resulted in enhanced interaction between PKCdelta and mEH. PKCdelta knockout mice exhibited significant attenuation of the enhanced mEH expression induced by MA. MA-induced hyperthermia, oxidative stress, proapoptotic potentials, and dopaminergic impairments were attenuated by PKCdelta knockout or mEH knockout in mice. However, treating mEH knockout in mice with PKCdelta inhibitor, rottlerin did not show any additive beneficial effects, indicating that mEH is a critical mediator of neurotoxic potential of PKCdelta. Our results suggest that MA-induced PKCdelta activation requires mEH induction as a downstream signaling pathway and that the modulation of the PKCdelta and mEH interaction is important for the pharmacological intervention against MA-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity.

31425786|t|Essential oils disrupt steroidogenesis in a feto-placental co-culture model.
31425786|a|We determined whether 5 common essential oils (basil, fennel seed, orange, black pepper and sage) interfered with feto-placental steroidogenesis in a co-culture model composed of fetal-like adrenocortical (H295R) and placental trophoblast-like (BeWo) cells. After a 24 h exposure, only basil and fennel seed oil significantly increased hormone concentrations of estradiol, estrone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androstenedione, progesterone, and estriol. Basil and fennel seed oil were shown to significantly alter the expression of steroidogenic enzymes involved in cholesterol transport and steroid hormone biosynthesis, including StAR, CYP11A1, 3beta-HSD1/2, SULT2A1, and HSD17beta1, -4, and -5. Also, basil and fennel seed oil stimulated placental-specific promoter I.1 and pII-derived CYP19 mRNA in BeWo and H295R cells, respectively, as well as, increased CYP19 enzyme activity. Our results indicate that further study is necessary to determine the potential risks of using basil and fennel seed oils during pregnancy considering their potential to disrupt steroidogenic enzyme activity and expression in vitro.

31428839|t|Protective effect of methylene blue on TNBS-induced colitis in rats mediated through the modulation of inflammatory and apoptotic signalling pathways.
31428839|a|Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a common type of chronic, idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that affects the mucosal lining of the colon. Long-term UC remission has shed light on the necessity of modified therapeutic strategies. In this study, UC was induced in rats by intrarectal administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). The anticolitis effect of methylene blue (MB), a well-known dye and antioxidant and a potent mitochondrial enhancer was tested. MB was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) at a dose of 1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg, and colosalazine was administered orally (p.o.) at a dose of 500 mg/kg 11 days after the administration of TNBS, which was injected on the 8th day. All treatment group results were compared to the TNBS group results. Macroscopically, limited body weight loss and decrease in the colon weight per unit length ratio were observed in the MB groups. MB improved histological damage and decreased the expression of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and accumulation of CD4+ lymphocytes observed by immunohistochemistry. Downregulation of Bax/Bcl2 protein expression was detected using Western blotting, and increased mRNA expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) was measured by qPCR. MB produced biochemical alterations, such as significant decrease in interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-17 (IL-17) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) levels measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Significant decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) levels as well as significant increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase levels were observed with MB, and these effects were similar to those produced by colosalazine. Thus, MB altered disease pathogenesis and could be a promising and challenging therapeutic target for UC treatment.

31433112|t|Resveratrol protects against cadmium chloride-induced hippocampal neurotoxicity by inhibiting ER stress and GAAD 153 and activating sirtuin 1/AMPK/Akt.
31433112|a|This study investigated whether the apoptotic effect induced by cadmium chloride (CdCl2 ) in rat's hippocampi and neuroprotection afforded by resveratrol (RES) are mediated by modulation of ER stress and involve sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)/AMPK/Akt axis. Adult male Wistar rats were divided into four groups (n = 24/group) as control, control + RES (300 mg/kg), CdCl2 (5 mg/kg), and CdCl2  + RES. All treatments were conducted orally for 45 days. Also, cultured hippocampal cells were treated with CdCl2 in the presence or absence of RES and with or without preincubation with SIRT1, AMPK, or PI3K inhibitors. CdCl2 impaired retention and spatial memories of rats and reduced levels and activities of SIRT1 and inhibited AMPK/Akt axis in their hippocamapi where SIRT1 was the upstream regulator. It also enahnced hippocampal levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and expression of caspase-12 and caspase-3, depleted glutathione (GSH) levels, and activated GRP78, activating transcription factor-6, GAAD 153, X-box binding protein-1 arms of ER stress. On the contrary, RES coadminsitration completley abolished all these events. Interstingly and in control rats, RES not only increased levels of GSH, but also enhenced protein levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and dwonregulated GAAD 153. In both control and CdCl2 -treated rats, pharmacological inhibtion of SIRT1, AMPK, and Akt compleltely abolished all effects afforded by RES. In conclusion, CdCl2 -induced hippocampal apopotis is associated with reduction of SIRT1/AMPK/Akt activity levels, ROS generation, downregulation of Bcl-2, and activities, activation of ER stress, and GAAD 153, whereas RES is able to reverse these effects through activation of SIRT1/AMPK/Akt.

31433962|t|Apoptotic activity of xanthoquinodin JBIR-99, from Parengyodontium album MEXU 30054, in PC-3 human prostate cancer cells.
31433962|a|Natural products are a valuable source of anticancer agents, with many naturally derived compounds currently used in clinical and preclinical treatments. This study aims to investigate the antiproliferative activity and potential mechanism of action of the xanthoquinodin JBIR-99, isolated from fungi Parengyodontium album MEXU 30,054 and identified by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. Cytotoxicity of xanthoquinodin was evaluated in a panel of human cancer cells lines and CCD-112-CoN normal colon cells, using the sulforhodamine B assay. PC-3 prostate cancer cells were used in biochemical assays including cell cycle, mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTP), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and caspase activity. Expression levels of apoptosis-pathway-related proteins were analyzed by Western blot. The in vivo toxicity of xanthoquinodin was determined using a zebrafish model. Xanthoquinodin showed cytotoxicity in all cancer cell lines but demonstrated relative selective potency against PC-3 cells with an IC50 1.7 muM. In CCD-112-CoN cells, xanthoquinodin was non-cytotoxic at 100 muM. In PC-3 cells, the compound induced loss of MTP, production of ROS, and cell cycle arrest in S phase. The expression and activity of caspase-3 was increased, which correlates with the upregulation of Cyt c, Bax, nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) (p65) and IKKbeta, and downregulation of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP-1) and Bcl-2. Lastly, xanthoquinodin did not cause any visible developmental toxicity in zebrafish at 50 muM. These results demonstrate xanthoquinodin induces apoptosis in PC-3 prostate cancer cells by activation of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. In addition, the non-toxic effect in vivo indicates that xanthoquinodin could be a useful lead in the development of a novel, anti-cancer agent that is selective for prostate cancer.

31437537|t|The roles of TG-interacting factor in cadmium exposure-promoted invasion and migration of lung cancer cells.
31437537|a|Cadmium (Cd) is an established human carcinogen. Previous documents have demonstrated the association of Cd exposure with lung cancer progression. However, the underlying mechanisms of Cd-promoted invasion and migration of lung cancer cells have not yet been fully understood. The objective of this study was to explore the functional roles of TG-interacting factor (TGIF) in Cd exposure-promoted invasion and migration of lung cancer cells. Lung cancer cells were exposed to Cd for eight weeks. Invasion assay and migration assay were used to evaluate the cell invasive and migratory ability. qRT-PCR and western blot analyses were applied to analyze the expression levels of mRNA and protein. Our results showed that Cd-exposed lung cancer cells expressed markedly increased TGIF protein and mRNA compared to control cells. Cd-exposed lung cancer cells exhibited higher migratory and invasive ability than control cells did. However, silencing TGIF blocked Cd exposure-accelerated lung cancer cell invasion and migration. In addition, we found that the upregulation of Snail protein expression induced by exposure to Cd was modulated by TGIF in lung cancer cells. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that TGIF might play a crucial role in invasion and migration of lung cancer cells exposed to Cd.

31442584|t|Critical role of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-Induced intestinal injury and repair.
31442584|a|Ulcerative colitis2 (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease3 (IBD) that causes long-lasting inflammation and ulcers in the human digestive tract. The repair function of TLR4 in the intestinal epithelium is still unknown. Here, wild-type4 (WT) mice, TLR4-knockout mice5 (KO; TLR4-/-) and commensal-depleted mice were used as dextran sulfate sodium6 (DSS)-induced or radiation-induced colitis and injury models to explore the role of TLR4 signaling in intestinal injury. Exogenous lipopolysaccharide7 (LPS) promoted DSS-induced inflammatory cytokines and aggravated intestinal damage. TLR4 deficiency and commensal bacterial depletion inhibited the toxic effects of LPS, but these mice were more susceptible to DSS-induced and radiation-induced intestinal damage. Compared with WT mice, neither DSS nor radiation promoted production of more inflammatory cytokines in the guts of TLR4-KO and commensal-depleted mice. Introducing the cytokine repair factors, PGE2 and GM-CSF, increased the cytokine levels in the guts of DSS-induced colitis mice. We hypothesized that TLR4 and its ligands repaired the epithelium after DSS-induced and radiation-induced intestinal damage by upregulating PGE2 and GM-CSF. Transwell migration assays suggested that LPS, IL6, TNF, PGE2 and GM-CSF promoted intestinal cell migration, and cell viability analysis suggested that these factors protected against radiation-induced intestinal damage. Our data underscore the importance of the balancing role of TLR4 in intestinal injury and repair.

31442592|t|Environmental chemicals differentially affect epigenetic-related mechanisms in the zebrafish liver (ZF-L) cell line and in zebrafish embryos.
31442592|a|A number of chemicals have been shown to affect epigenetic patterning and functions. Since epigenetic mechanisms regulate transcriptional networks, epigenetic changes induced by chemical exposure can represent early molecular events for long-term adverse physiological effects. Epigenetics has thus appeared as a research field of major interest within (eco)toxicological sciences. The present study aimed at measuring effects on epigenetic-related mechanisms of selected environmental chemicals (bisphenols, perfluorinated chemicals, methoxychlor, permethrin, vinclozolin and coumarin 47) in zebrafish embryos and liver cells (ZFL). Transcription of genes related to DNA methylation and histone modifications was measured and global DNA methylation was assessed in ZFL cells using the LUMA assay. The differences in results gathered from both models suggest that chemicals affect different mechanisms related to epigenetics in embryos and cells. In zebrafish embryos, exposure to bisphenol A, coumarin 47, methoxychlor and permethrin lead to significant transcriptional changes in epigenetic factors suggesting that they can impact early epigenome reprogramming related to embryonic development. In ZFL cells, significant transcriptional changes were observed upon exposure to all chemicals but coumarin 47; however, only perfluorooctane sulfonate induced significant effects on global DNA methylation. Notably, in contrast to the other tested chemicals, perfluorooctane sulfonate affected only the expression of the histone demethylase kdm5ba. In addition, kdm5ba appeared as a sensitive gene in zebrafish embryos as well. Taken together, the present results suggest a role for kdm5ba in regulating epigenetic patterns in response to chemical exposure, even though mechanisms remain unclear. To confirm these findings, further evidence is required regarding changes in site-specific histone marks and DNA methylation together with their long-term effects on physiological outcomes.

31444509|t|Microsomal prostaglandin E synthase 2 deficiency is resistant to acetaminophen-induced liver injury.
31444509|a|Acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury is the main cause of acute liver failure. This study investigated the role of microsomal prostaglandin E synthase 2 (mPGES-2), discovered as one of the prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthases, in mediating APAP-induced liver injury. Using mPGES-2 wild-type (WT) and knockout (KO) mice, marked resistance to APAP-induced liver damage was found in mPGES-2 KO, as indicated by robust improvement of liver histology, changes in liver enzyme release, and marked decrease in APAP-cysteine adducts (APAP-CYS) and inflammatory markers. Moreover, the results confirmed that increase in liver PGE2 content in KO mice under basal conditions was not critical for the protection from APAP-induced liver injury. Importantly, mPGES-2 deletion inhibited the production of malondialdehyde (MDA), increasing glutathione (GSH) level. Enhanced GSH level may contribute to the inhibition of APAP toxicity in mPGES-2 KO mice. To further elucidate the role of mPGES-2 in the liver injury induced by APAP, adeno-associated viruses (AAV) were used to overexpress mPGES-2 in the liver. The results showed that mPGES-2 overexpression aggravates liver injury associated with an increase in inflammatory markers and chemokines after APAP treatment. Moreover, a lower level of GSH was detected in the mPGES-2 overexpression group compared to the control group. Collectively, our findings indicate that mPGES-2 plays a critical role in regulating APAP-induced liver injury, possibly by regulating GSH and APAP-CYS level, which may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for the prevention and treatment of APAP-induced liver injury.

31461164|t|Activation of Cannabinoid Receptors Promote Periodontal Cell Adhesion and Migration.
31461164|a|OBJECTIVE: Medical and recreational cannabis use is increasing significantly, but its impacts on oral health remains unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major active component in cannabis, on periodontal fibroblast cell adhesion and migration to explore its role in periodontal regeneration and wound healing. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The different distribution of cannabinoid receptors 1 (CB1) and 2 (CB2) was characterized in the mouse periodontium. Human periodontal fibroblast cell (HPLF) adhesion and migration was analyzed by in vitro wound healing assay with and without THC. The focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling pathway was investigated to uncover the underlying cellular mechanism. The receptor dependency of cannabinoid effects was examined by using selective antagonists to block THC. RESULTS: Both CB1 and CB2 were expressed in periodontal tissues but with different expression patterns. THC promoted periodontal cell wound healing by inducing HPLF cell adhesion and migration. This was mediated by focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation and its modulation of MAPK activities. The effect of cannabinoids on periodontal fibroblast cell adhesion and migration were mainly dependent on the CB2. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that cannabinoids may contribute to developing new therapeutics for periodontal regeneration and wound healing.

31470032|t|Thromboxane A2 receptor signaling in endothelial cells attenuates monocrotaline-induced liver injury.
31470032|a|Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) is a major complication of chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The early stage of SOS is characterized by liver sinusoidal endothelial cell (LSEC) injury accompanied by platelet aggregation. Thromboxane A2 (TxA2) induces platelet aggregation through the thromboxane prostanoid (TP) receptor. In this study, we explored the role of TP signaling in a monocrotaline (MCT)-induced mouse model of SOS. Relative to wild-type (WT) mice, TP-deficient (TP-/-) mice exhibited more severe MCT-liver injury, as indicated by elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and coagulative necrosis. Extensive accumulation of platelets in the liver was observed in both WT and TP-/- mice. TP expression co-localized with CD31-positive LSECs. MCT treatment caused LSEC destruction, concomitant with elevated expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and adhesion molecules in WT mice, and LSEC damage was further exacerbated in TP-/- mice. Viability of isolated LSECs was lower in cells from TP-/- mice, whereas mRNA levels of MMPs and adhesion molecules were higher; U46619, a TxA2 agonist, reduced these levels in WT mice. These data suggest that TP signaling has no effect on platelet accumulation during MCT-induced liver injury, but instead prevents injury by suppressing LSEC damage.

31472228|t|MiR-92a antagonized the facilitation effect of extracellular matrix protein 1 in GC metastasis through targeting its 3'UTR region.
31472228|a|MicroRNAs were known to play very important roles in human diseases, and have attracted great interests of research scientists in medicine, toxicology and functional foods. Gastric carcinoma (GC) remains one of the most common and lethal types of malignancy worldwide. However, the molecular mechanism of GC and the role of microRNAs in GC development remain unclear. The expression of extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1) is up-regulated in many cancer types, but its functional role is inconstant. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the correlation between GC development and ECM1 expression, along with its regulation by microRNAs. Immunohistochemical results showed that ECM1 was up-regulated in GC tissues and ECM1 expression level was negatively correlated with the prognosis of GC. ECM1 was found to promote gastric cancer cell metastasis in cell migration assays by facilitating the expression of proteins involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). MiR-92a was recognized for the first time to suppress the migration of human GC cells by directly targeting to the 3'UTR of ECM1 gene in a dual-luciferase reporter assay. These results highlighted the antagonistic roles of ECM1 and miR-92a in GC development, which may serve as a new target for gastric cancer.

31476115|t|Small Molecule Antipsychotic Aripiprazole Potentiates Ozone-Induced Inflammation in Airway Epithelium.
31476115|a|Inhaled ground level ozone (O3) has well described adverse health effects, which may be augmented in susceptible populations. While conditions, such as pre-existing respiratory disease, have been identified as factors enhancing susceptibility to O3-induced health effects, the potential for chemical interactions in the lung to sensitize populations to pollutant-induced responses has not yet been studied. In the airways, inhaled O3 reacts with lipids, such as cholesterol, to generate reactive and electrophilic oxysterol species, capable of causing cellular dysfunction and inflammation. The enzyme regulating the final step of cholesterol biosynthesis, 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7), converts 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) to cholesterol. Inhibition of DHCR7 increases the levels of 7-DHC, which is much more susceptible to oxidation than cholesterol. Chemical analysis established the capacity for a variety of small molecule antipsychotic drugs, like Aripiprazole (APZ), to inhibit DHCR7 and elevate circulating 7-DHC. Our results show that APZ and the known DHCR7 inhibitor, AY9944, increase 7-DHC levels in airway epithelial cells and potentiate O3-induced IL-6 and IL-8 expression and cytokine release. Targeted immune-related gene array analysis demonstrates that APZ significantly modified O3-induced expression of 16 genes, causing dysregulation in expression of genes associated with leukocyte recruitment and inflammatory response. Additionally, we find that APZ increases O3-induced IL-6 and IL-8 expression in human nasal epithelial cells from male but not female donors. Overall, the evidence we provide describes a novel molecular mechanism by which chemicals, such as APZ, that perturb cholesterol biosynthesis affect O3-induced biological responses.

31478295|t|Inhibition profiles of Voriconazole against acetylcholinesterase, alpha-glycosidase, and human carbonic anhydrase I and II isoenzymes.
31478295|a|In this work, the inhibitory activity of Voriconazole was measured against some metabolic enzymes, including human carbonic anhydrase (hCA) I and II isoenzymes, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and alpha-glycosidase; the results were compared with standard compounds including acetazolamide, tacrine, and acarbose. Half maximal inhibition concentration (IC50 ) values were obtained from the enzyme activity (%)-[Voriconazole] graphs, whereas Ki values were calculated from the Lineweaver-Burk graphs. According to the results, the IC50 value of Voriconazole was 40.77 nM for alpha-glycosidase, while the mean inhibition constant (Ki ) value was 17.47 +- 1.51 nM for alpha-glycosidase. The results make an important contribution to drug design and have pharmacological applications. In addition, the Voriconazole compound demonstrated excellent inhibitory effects against AChE and hCA isoforms I and II. Voriconazole had Ki values of 29.13 +- 3.57 nM against hCA I, 15.92 +- 1.90 nM against hCA II, and 10.50 +- 2.46 nM against AChE.

31481676|t|Innate immune responses to paraquat exposure in a Drosophila model of Parkinson's disease.
31481676|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative movement disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Limited understanding of the early molecular pathways associated with the demise of DA neurons, including those of inflammatory exacerbation of neurodegeneration, is a major impediment to therapeutic development. Recent studies have implicated gene-environment interactions in PD susceptibility. We used transcriptomic profiling in a Drosophila PD model in response to paraquat (PQ)-induced oxidative stress to identify pre-symptomatic signatures of impending neuron dysfunction. Our RNAseq data analysis revealed extensive regulation of innate immune response genes following PQ ingestion. We found that PQ exposure leads to the activation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor, Relish, and the stress signaling factor JNK, encoded by the gene basket in Drosophila. Relish knockdown in the dopaminergic neurons confers PQ resistance and rescues mobility defects and DA neuron loss. Furthermore, PQ-induced toxicity is mediated through the immune deficiency signaling pathway. Surprisingly, the expression of Relish-dependent anti-microbial peptide (AMPs) genes is suppressed upon PQ exposure causing increased sensitivity to Gram-negative bacterial infection. This work provides a novel link between PQ exposure and innate immune system modulation underlying environmental toxin-induced neurodegeneration, thereby underscoring the role of the innate immune system in PD pathogenesis.

31485614|t|MicroRNA-608 sensitizes non-small cell lung cancer cells to cisplatin by targeting TEAD2.
31485614|a|Cisplatin has been widely used as a conventional treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, primary and acquired cisplatin resistances are frequently developed during the treatment of patients with NSCLC, leading to an increased mortality rate. Accumulating evidence demonstrated that aberrantly expressed microRNAs (miRs) are involved in the development of chemoresistance. In the present study, sensitivity of NSCLC cells to cisplatin was identified to increase following overexpression of miR-608. Conversely, sensitivity to cisplatin was reduced following miR-608 knockdown. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting analyses identified that TEA domain transcription factor 2 (TEAD2), a key regulator of cell stemness, was negatively regulated by miR-608 in NSCLC cells. By repressing TEAD2, miR-608 decreased the expression level of several target genes of the Hippo-yes-associated protein signaling pathway. Furthermore, TEAD2 mRNA was confirmed to be targeted by miR-608 in NSCLC cells via a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Importantly, the increased cisplatin sensitivity induced by miR-608 overexpression was reversed by transfection of TEAD2 in NSCLC cells. The present data suggested that miR-608 may represent a novel candidate biomarker for the evaluation of cisplatin sensitivity in patients with NSCLC.

31494105|t|"Verteporfin exhibits anti-proliferative activity in embryonal and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines".
31494105|a|Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a pediatric tumor, which arises from muscle precursor cells. Recently, it has been demonstrated that Hippo Pathway (Hpo), a pathway that regulates several physiological and biological features, is involved in RMS tumorigenesis. For instance, an upregulation of the Hpo downstream effector Yes-Associated Protein 1 (YAP) leads to the development of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (eRMS) in murine activated muscle satellite cells. On the other hand, the YAP paralog transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) is overexpressed in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (aRMS) patients with poor survival. YAP and TAZ exhibit both cytoplasmic and nuclear functions. In the nucleus, YAP binds TEADs (TEA domain family members) factors and together they constitute a complex that is able either to activate the transcription of several genes such as MYC, Tbx5 and PAX8 or to maintain the stability of others like p73. Due to the key role of YAP and TAZ in cancer, the identification and/or development of new compounds able to block their activity might be an effective antineoplastic strategy. Verteporfin (VP) is a molecule able to stop the formation of YAP/TEAD complex in the nucleus. The aim of this study is to evaluate the action of VP on RMS cell lines. This work shows that VP has an anti-proliferative activity on all RMS cell lines analyzed. Depending on RMS cell lines, VP affects cell cycle differently. Moreover, VP is able to decrease YAP protein levels, and to induce the activation of apoptosis mechanism through the cleavage of PARP-1. In addition, Annexin V assay showed the activation of apoptosis and necrosis after VP treatment. In summary, the ability of VP to disrupt RMS cell proliferation could be a novel and valuable strategy to improve the therapeutic approaches in treating rhabdomyosarcoma.

31494106|t|FOXP1 inhibits high glucose-induced ECM accumulation and oxidative stress in mesangial cells.
31494106|a|Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a common complication of diabetes that remains the major cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Forkhead box P1 (FOXP1) is a member of FOX family involved in the progression of diabetes. However, the pathogenic role of FOXP1 in DN remains unclear. This study was aimed to explore the effects of FOXP1 on glomerular mesangial cells (MCs) in response to high glucose (HG) stimulation. We found that HG stimulation markedly inhibited the FOXP1 expression in MCs in dose-and time-dependent manner. CCK-8 assay proved that FOXP1 overexpression attenuated HG-induced cell proliferation in MCs. FOXP1 exhibited anti-oxidative activity in HG-induced MCs, as proved by the decreased production of ROS and expressions of ROS producing enzymes, NADPH oxidase (NOX) 2 and NOX4. Besides, FOXP1 suppressed the expression and secretion of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins including collagen IV (Col IV) and fibronectin (FN). Furthermore, FOXP1 overexpression significantly prevented HG-induced activation of Akt/mTOR signaling in MCs, and Akt activator blocked FOXP1-mediated cell proliferation, ROS production and ECM accumulation in MCs. Collectively, FOXP1 prevented HG-induced proliferation, oxidative stress, and ECM accumulation in MCs via inhibiting the activation of Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. The findings suggested that FOXP1 might be a therapeutic target for the treatment of DN.

31506784|t|Beta-ionone-inhibited proliferation of breast cancer cells by inhibited COX-2 activity.
31506784|a|As one of the isoprenoids and widely derived from many fruits and vegetables, beta-ionone (BI) has a potent inhibitory proliferation of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. However, its exact mechanism is still uncompleted understood and needs to be further verified. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), as a potential target of cancer chemoprevention, has been played pivotal roles in proliferation of tumor cells and carcinogenesis. Thus, the objective of present study was to determine that BI inhibited the activity of COX-2 in breast cancer and related to cancer cell models. Cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, the distribution of cell cycle, apoptosis induction and the expression of P38-MAPK protein were determined in MCF-7 cells by methylene blue, 3H-thymidine (TdR) incorporation, flow cytometry, TUNEL and Western blotting assays. Quinone reductase (QR) activity was determined in murine hepatoma Hepa1c1c7 cells by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of COX-2 in a phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-induced cell model and mammary tumor tissues was examined by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The results showed that BI significantly inhibited cell proliferation and DNA synthesis, arrested the distribution of cell cycle at the S phase or decreased proteins related to cell cycle such as cyclin D1 and CDK4, induced apoptosis and increased the expression of p-P38 in MCF-7 cells. BI at low doses (&lt; 50 mumol/L) significantly increased QR activity, decreased the expression of COX-2 protein and prostaglandin E2 (PEG2) release in cell models. In addition, BI also significantly decreased the expression of COX-2 protein in rat mammary tumor tissues. Therefore, our findings indicate that BI possesses inhibitory proliferation of breast cancer cells through down-regulation of COX-2 activity.

31515601|t|Sulfur mustard alkylates steroid hormones and impacts hormone function in vitro.
31515601|a|The chemical warfare agent sulfur mustard (SM) alkylates a multitude of biomacromolecules including DNA and proteins. Cysteine residues and nucleophilic nitrogen atoms in purine DNA bases are typical targets of SM but potentially every nucleophilic structure may be alkylated by SM. In the present study, we analyzed potential SM-induced alkylation of glucocorticoid (GC) hormones and functional consequences thereof. Hydrocortisone (HC), the synthetic betamethasone (BM) and dexamethasone (DEX) were chosen as representative GCs. Structural modifications were assessed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The hypothesized alkylation was verified and structurally allocated to the OH-group of the C21 atom. The biological function of SM-alkylated GCs was investigated using GC-regulated dual-luciferase reporter gene assays and an ex vivo GC responsiveness assay coupled with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). For the reporter gene assays, HEK293-cells were transiently transfected with a dual-luciferase reporter gene that is transcriptional regulated by a GC-response element. These cells were then incubated either with untreated or SM-derivatized HC, BM or DEX. Firefly-luciferase (Fluc) activity was determined 24 h after stimulation. Fluc-activity significantly decreased after stimulation with SM-pre-exposed GC dependent on the SM concentration. The ex vivo RT-qPCR-based assay for human peripheral leukocyte responsiveness to DEX revealed a transcriptional dysregulation of GC-regulated genes (FKBP5, IL1R2, and GILZ) after stimulation with SM-alkylated DEX. Our results present GCs as new biological targets of SM associated with a disturbance of hormone function.

31515991|t|In Vitro Metabolism of Auriculasin and Its Inhibitory Effects on Human Cytochrome P450 and UDP-Glucuronosyltransferase Enzymes.
31515991|a|Auriculasin has a wide range of pharmacological effects, including anticancer and anti-inflammatory effects. In this work, we explored the metabolic characteristics and inhibitory effect of auriculasin against cytochrome P450 (CYP) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes in vitro. Auriculasin inhibited UGT1A6, UGT1A8, UGT1A10, UGT2B7, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 strongly at a concentration of 100 muM. Different species showed significant differences in auriculasin metabolism, and metabolic characteristics were similar between pig and human. We identified seven metabolites, and hydroxylated auriculasin was the main metabolite. In addition, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2C8 were the major CYP isoforms involved in the metabolism of auriculasin. Molecular docking studies showed that noncovalent interactions between auriculasin and the CYPs are dominated by hydrogen bonding, pi-pi stacking, and hydrophobic interactions. Our in vitro study provides insights into the pharmacological and toxicological mechanisms of auriculasin.

31518551|t|High-throughput method for in process monitoring of 3-O-sulfotransferase catalyzed sulfonation in bioengineered heparin synthesis.
31518551|a|Bioengineered heparin (BEH) offers a potential alternative for the preparation of a safer pharmacological heparin. Construction of in-process control assays for tracking each enzymatic step during bioengineered heparin synthesis remains a challenge. Here, we report a high-throughput sensing platform based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and enzymatic signal amplification that allows the rapid and accurate monitoring of the 3-OST sulfonation in BEH synthesis process. The anticoagulant activity of target BEH was measured to reflect the degree of sulfonation by testing its competitive antithrombin (AT) binding ability. BEH samples with different sulfonation degrees show different AT protein binding capacity and thus changes the UV response to a different extent. This BEH-induced signal can be conveniently and sensitively monitored by the plate sensing system, which benefits from its high sensitivity brought in by the enzymatic signal amplification. Furthermore, modification convenience and mechanical robustness also ensure the stability of the test platform. This proposed strategy exhibits excellent analytical performance in both BEH activity analysis and 3-OST sulfonation evaluation. The simple and sensitive plate system shows great potential in developing on-chip, high-throughput methods for fundamental biochemical process research, drug discovery, and clinic diagnostics.

31521043|t|Effects of the organochlorine p,p'-DDT on MCF-7 cells: Investigating metabolic and immune modulatory transcriptomic changes.
31521043|a|The organochlorine pesticide dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) is persistent in the environment and leads to adverse human health effects. High levels in breast milk pose a threat to both breast tissue and nursing infants. The objectives of this study were to investigate DDT-induced transcriptomic alterations in enzymes and transporters involved in xenobiotic metabolism, immune responses, oxidative stress markers, and cell growth in a human breast cancer cell line. MCF-7 cells were exposed to both environmentally-relevant and previously-tested concentrations of p,p'-DDT in a short-term experiment. Significant up-regulation of metabolizing enzymes and transporters (ACHE, GSTO1, NQO1 and ABCC2) and oxidative stress markers (CXCL8, HMOX-1, NFE2L2 and TNF) was clearly observed. Conversely, UGT1A6, AHR and cell growth genes (FGF2 and VEGFA) were severely down-regulated. Identification of these genes helps to identify mechanisms of p,p'-DDT action within cells and may be considered as useful biomarkers for exposure to DDT contamination.

31521693|t|Neuroprotective effects of glucomoringin-isothiocyanate against H2O2-Induced cytotoxicity in neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells.
31521693|a|Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are pathological conditions characterised by progressive damage of neuronal cells leading to eventual loss of structure and function of the cells. Due to implication of multi-systemic complexities of signalling pathways in NDDs, the causes and preventive mechanisms are not clearly delineated. The study was designed to investigate the potential signalling pathways involved in neuroprotective activities of purely isolated glucomoringin isothiocyanate (GMG-ITC) against H2O2-induced cytotoxicity in neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells. GMG-ITC was isolated from Moringa oleifera seeds, and confirmed with NMR and LC-MS based methods. Gene expression analysis of phase II detoxifying markers revealed significant increase in the expression of all the genes involved, due to GMG-ITC pre-treatment. GMG-ITC also caused significant decreased in the expression of NF-kB, BACE1, APP and increased the expressions of IkB and MAPT tau genes in the differentiated cells as confirmed by multiplex genetic system analysis. The effect was reflected on the expressed proteins in the differentiated cells, where GMG-ITC caused increased in expression level of Nrf2, SOD-1, NQO1, p52 and c-Rel of nuclear factor erythroid factor 2 (Nrf2) and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB) pathways respectively. The findings revealed the potential of GMG-ITC to abrogate oxidative stress-induced neurodegeneration through Nrf2 and NF-kB signalling pathways.

31526819|t|Propionic acid induces mitochondrial dysfunction and affects gene expression for mitochondria biogenesis and neuronal differentiation in SH-SY5Y cell line.
31526819|a|Studies in animal models have shown that the short-chain fatty acid, propionic acid (PPA), interferes with mitochondrial metabolism leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and behavioral abnormalities. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of PPA on mitochondrial function and gene expression in neuronal cells. SH-SY5Y cells and normal human neural progenitor (NHNP) cells were exposed to 1, 5 mM PPA for 4 or 24 h and we found that the mitochondrial potential measured in SH-SY5Y cells decreased in a dose-dependent manner after PPA treatment. Electron microscopy analysis revealed that the size of the mitochondria was significantly reduced following PPA treatment. A dose-dependent increase in the mitochondrial DNA copy number was observed in the PPA-treated cells. The expression of the mitochondrial biogenesis-related proteins PGC-1alpha, TFAM, SIRT3, and COX4 was significantly increased after PPA treatment. Transcriptome analysis revealed that mRNA expression in the notch signaling-related genes ASCL1 and LFNG changed after PPA treatment and the positive correlated protein expression changes were also observed. These results revealed that PPA treatment may affect neurodevelopment by altering mitochondrial function and notch signaling-related gene expression.

31549646|t|Organophosphorus flame retardant (tricresyl phosphate) trigger apoptosis in HepG2 cells: Transcriptomic evidence on activation of human cancer pathways.
31549646|a|Tricresyl phosphate (TCP) is one of the organophosphorus flame retardants (OPFRs) used as plasticizer in consumer products and mixed as a lubricant in commercial jet engine oil, reportedly induce neurotoxicity and aerodynamic syndrome. No studies have been attempted so far on TCP to induce hepatotoxicity in human cells. This study for the first time confirms the hepatotoxic potential and activation of cancer pathways in TCP treated human hepatocellular cells (HepG2). MTT and NRU data showed 39.3% and 49.85% decline in HepG2 survival when exposed to the highest concentration of TCP (400 muM) for 3 days. Comet assay showed 27.1-fold greater DNA damage in cells treated with TCP (400 muM). Flow cytometric analysis revealed an upsurge in the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) production in cells, affirming oxidative stress. TCP (400 muM) exposure resulted in 27% reduction in Rh123 fluorescence, indicating dysfunction of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim). Cell cycle analysis exhibited 62.53% cells in the subG1 apoptotic phase after TCP (400 muM) treatment, also a massive increase in Ca2+ influx validate the on-set of apoptosis in cells. Immunofluorescence of TCP exposed cells showed activation of p53, caspase3, caspase9 reaffirming the involvement of mitochondrial-dependent intrinsic apoptotic signaling. qPCR array of 84 genes unravel the transcriptomic alterations in HepG2 cells after TCP treatment. mRNA transcripts of ATP5A1, GADD45A, IGFBP5, SOD1, STMN1 genes were prominently upregulated providing candid evidence on TCP mediated activation of human cancer pathways to orchestrate the apoptotic death of HepG2 cells, specifying hepatotoxic potential of TCP.

31551929|t|BPA Alters Estrogen Receptor Expression in the Heart After Viral Infection Activating Cardiac Mast Cells and T Cells Leading to Perimyocarditis and Fibrosis.
31551929|a|Myocarditis is an inflammatory heart disease that leads to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and heart failure. Sex hormones play an important role in the development of myocarditis with testosterone driving disease in males and estrogen being cardioprotective in females. The human population is widely exposed to the endocrine disruptor bisphenol A (BPA) from plastics such as water bottles, plastic food containers, copy paper, and receipts. Several clinical and numerous animal studies have found an association between elevated BPA levels and cardiovascular disease. A recent report found elevated levels of BPA in the serum of patients with DCM compared to healthy controls. In this study we examined whether exposure to BPA for 2 weeks prior to viral infection and leading up to myocarditis at day 10 altered inflammation in female BALB/c mice housed in standard plastic cages/water bottles with soy-free food and bedding. We found that a human relevant dose of BPA (25 mug/L) in drinking water, with an estimated exposure of 5 mug BPA/kg BW, significantly increased myocarditis and pericarditis compared to control water without altering viral genome levels in the heart. BPA exposure activated ERalpha and ERbeta in the spleen 24 h after infection and phosphorylated ERalpha and ERbeta during myocarditis, but decreased ERalpha and increased ERbeta mRNA in the heart as measured by qRT-PCR. Exposure to BPA significantly increased CD4+ T cells, IFNgamma, IL-17A, TLR4, caspase-1, and IL-1beta in the heart. BPA exposure also increased cardiac fibrosis compared to controls. Mast cells, which are associated with cardiac remodeling, were found to increase in number and degranulation, particularly along the pericardium. Interestingly, plastic caging/water bottle exposure alone led to increased mast cell numbers, pericardial degranulation and fibrosis in female BALB/c mice compared to animals housed in glass cages/water bottles with soy-free food and bedding. These data suggest that BPA exposure may increase the risk of developing myocarditis after a viral infection in women.

31557371|t|Upregulation of FSHR and PCNA by administration of coenzyme Q10 on cyclophosphamide-induced premature ovarian failure in a mouse model.
31557371|a|Cyclophosphamide (CTX) has been broadly used in the clinic for the treatment of autoimmune disorders and ovarian cancer. The process of chemotherapy has significant toxicity in the reproductive system as it has detrimental effects on folliculogenesis, which leads to an irreversible premature ovarian failure (POF). Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) has positive impacts on the reproductive system due to its antioxidant properties, protecting the cells from free-radical oxidative damage and apoptosis. However, little is known about the possible synergistic effect of CTX and CoQ10 on the expression of genes involved in folliculogenesis, such as proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR). A total of 32 NMRI mice were applied and divided into four groups, including healthy control, CTX, CTX + CoQ10, and CoQ10 groups. The effects of CoQ10 on CTX-induced ovarian injury and folliculogenesis were examined by histopathological and real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses. The rates of fertilization (in vitro fertilization), embryo development, as well as the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in metaphase II (MII) mouse oocytes after PMSG/HCC treatment were also assessed. Results showed that the treatment with CTX decreased the mRNA expression of PCNA and FSHR, IVF rate, and embryo development whereas the application of CoQ10 successfully reversed those factors. CoQ10 administration significantly enhanced histological morphology and decreased ROS levels and the number of atretic follicles in the ovary of CTX-treated mice. In conclusion, it seems that the protective effect of CoQ10 is exerted via the antioxidant and proliferative properties of this substance on CTX-induced ovarian damage.

31563592|t|Famotidine has a neuroprotective effect on MK-801 induced toxicity via the Akt/GSK-3beta/beta-catenin signaling pathway in the SH-SY5Y cell line.
31563592|a|Schizophrenia cannot be treated sufficiently with existing antipsychotic drugs. Taken into account that increased Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 Beta (GSK-3beta) activity is associated with schizophrenia pathophysiology and certain antipsychotics can be able to decrease GSK3beta activity, inhibition of GSK-3beta activity could be a novel approach for the treatment of schizophrenia. In the present study MK-801, a widely used chemical for the in vivo/in vitro modeling of schizophrenia was selected to evoke a detrimental effect on cellular survival via GSK3beta and related proteins. A limited number of studies have reported the curative effects of famotidine, an antiulcer drug, in schizophrenic patients. To the best of our knowledge, no study investigated the molecular mechanism of the beneficial effect of famotidine in the patients. A recent study based on computerized drug modeling software (docking) indicated that famotidine might inhibit the GSK3beta activity due to its chemical structure independent from histaminergic receptors. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of famotidine on the Akt/GSK-3beta/beta-catenin signaling pathway on SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells in the presence of MK-801. We investigated the effects of famotidine, olanzapine (an antipsychotic drug), and SB 415286 (specific GSK-3beta inhibitor), on the basal cellular survival and MK-801 induced neuronal death beside of Akt/GSK-3beta/beta-catenin protein and gene expressions in SH-SY5Y cells. Cell viability, protein and gene expressions were determined by the real-time cell analysis (xCELLigence) system, western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reactions (Rt-PCR), respectively. Our findings suggested that MK-801 administration decreased cell survival probably via the increasing GSK-3beta gene expression and activity in the SH-SY5Y cells. Pre-treatments with famotidine, olanzapine, and SB 415286 prevented MK-801 induced cell death via inhibitory effects on the MK-801 induced GSK-3beta activity. Overall, the present results suggest that famotidine has a neuroprotective effect against MK-801 via modulation of the Akt/GSK-3beta/beta-catenin signaling pathway, an important mechanism in schizophrenia neurobiology.

31563593|t|Pathophysiological roles of autophagy and aldo-keto reductases in development of doxorubicin resistance in gastrointestinal cancer cells.
31563593|a|Here, we show that incubation of three human gastrointestinal cancer cell lines (HCT15, LoVo and MKN45) with doxorubicin (DOX) provokes autophagy through facilitating production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). HCT15 cell treatment with DOX resulted in up-regulation of Beclin1, down-regulation of Bcl2, activation of AMPK and JNK, and Akt inactivation, all of which were restored by pretreating with an antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine. These data suggest that all the autophagy-related alterations evoked by DOX result from the ROS production. In the DOX-resistant cancer cells, degree of autophagy elicited by DOX was milder than the parental cells, and DOX treatment hardly activated the ROS-dependent apoptotic signals [formation of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), cytochrome-c release into cytosol, and activation of JNK and caspase-3], inferring an inverse correlation between cellular antioxidant capacity and autophagy induction by DOX. Monitoring of expression levels of aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) in the parental and DOX-resistant cells revealed an up-regulation of AKR1B10 and/or AKR1C3 with acquiring the DOX resistance. Knockdown and inhibition of AKR1B10 or AKR1C3 in these cells enhanced DOX-elicited autophagy. Measurement of DOX-reductase activity and HNE-sensitivity assay also suggested that both AKR1B10 (via high HNE-reductase activity) and AKR1C3 (via low HNE-reductase and DOX-reductase activities) are involved in the development of DOX resistance. Combination of inhibitors of autophagy and the two AKRs overcame DOX resistance and cross-resistance of gastrointestinal cancer cells with resistance development to DOX or cis-diamminedichloroplatinum. Therefore, concomitant treatment with the inhibitors may be effective as an adjuvant therapy for elevating DOX sensitivity of gastrointestinal cancer cells.

31568847|t|Di-n-butyl phthalate induced autophagy of uroepithelial cells via inhibition of hedgehog signaling in newborn male hypospadias rats.
31568847|a|Maternal exposure to di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) induces hypospadias via regulation of autophagy in uroepithelial cells. Here, we use gene express analysis to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. Pregnant rats received DBP orally at a dose of 750 mg/kg/day during gestational days 14-18. Gene expression analysis showed an increased expression of the hedgehog interacting protein (HhIP) gene. In DBP-induced hypospadiac male offspring, immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining and Western blot analysis confirmed increased expression of the HhIP protein and inhibited hedgehog signaling. In vitro experiments suggest the involvement of the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-HhIP-Gli1-autophagy axis in DBP-treated primary rat urethral epithelial cells. Taken together, our findings show that prenatal exposure to DBP induces abnormal hedgehog signaling and autophagy in uroepithelial cells that may play important roles in the development of hypospadias.

31570891|t|Germline NPM1 mutations lead to altered rRNA 2'-O-methylation and cause dyskeratosis congenita.
31570891|a|RNA modifications are emerging as key determinants of gene expression. However, compelling genetic demonstrations of their relevance to human disease are lacking. Here, we link ribosomal RNA 2'-O-methylation (2'-O-Me) to the etiology of dyskeratosis congenita. We identify nucleophosmin (NPM1) as an essential regulator of 2'-O-Me on rRNA by directly binding C/D box small nucleolar RNAs, thereby modulating translation. We demonstrate the importance of 2'-O-Me-regulated translation for cellular growth, differentiation and hematopoietic stem cell maintenance, and show that Npm1 inactivation in adult hematopoietic stem cells results in bone marrow failure. We identify NPM1 germline mutations in patients with dyskeratosis congenita presenting with bone marrow failure and demonstrate that they are deficient in small nucleolar RNA binding. Mice harboring a dyskeratosis congenita germline Npm1 mutation recapitulate both hematological and nonhematological features of dyskeratosis congenita. Thus, our findings indicate that impaired 2'-O-Me can be etiological to human disease.

31573559|t|[Evaluation of the effect of prostaglandin analogues and a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor/beta-blocker combination on the ocular blood flow in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma].
31573559|a|PURPOSE: To assess the effect of latanoprost and fixed combination of dorzolamide/timolol on ocular hemodynamics in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study examined 34 patients (56 eyes) aged 51 to 69 years (average - 62.4+-9.7 years) diagnosed with POAG in the initial (31 eyes) or advanced stage (25 eyes). Patients of the first group (20 patients, 36 eyes) were receiving latanoprost (Glauprost, Rompharm Company, Romania). The second group (14 patients, 20 eyes) was assigned to receive a fixed combination of dorzolamide/timolol (Dorzopt plus, Rompharm Company, Romania). Patient examination before and at 6 and 12 months included tonometry (ICare PRO), perimetry (Heidelberg Edge Perimeter), HRT and OCT of the optic nerve (Heidelberg Retina Tomograph 3 and Spectralis OCT2), as well as measurement of the density of surface (SVL) and deep (DVL) vascular plexus, and the Bruch's membrane opening minimum rim width (BMO-MRW). Additionally, we evaluated microcirculation in the choroid (MC) according to our original technique that uses Spectralis OCT2, and calculated rheographic index (RI) and stroke volume using transpalpebral rheoophthalmography. RESULTS: The decrease in IOP in the Latanoprost group was on average 27% and in the control group receiving timolol and dorzolamide - on average 22% and remained stable until the end of the study. The value of the area and volume of the disc rim band, BMO-MRW did not exhibit statistically significant changes in both groups by the 12th month of observation. A tendency to increase the RI from 51.5+-24.5 to 62.2+-19 (p=0.084) and the median of the index of microcirculation of the choroid (MC) from 16476 up to 23767 (p=0.062) in 1st group was observed. CONCLUSION: The study confirms the feasibility of using latanoprost and a fixed combination of dorzolamide and timolol in ocular hypotensive therapy of glaucoma thanks to their pronounced hypotensive effect. Patients were noted to have a tendency for improvement of ocular hemodynamics when using latanoprost.

31579237|t|Detection and genetic characterization of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases producers in a tertiary care hospital.
31579237|a|BACKGROUND: Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms inactivate extended beta-lactam antibiotics and monobactams and also exhibit coresistance to many other classes of antibiotics. The present study was carried out to assess the prevalence of the ESBLs and to determine the most prevalent genotype in our hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All clinically significant Gram-negative isolates were identified, and their antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done by Kirby-Bauers' disc diffusion method. ESBL detection was confirmed by minimal inhibitory concentration method using agar dilution technique for those who screened positive by ceftazidime (30 mug) disc. Further, the established ESBL-positive isolates were subjected to genotyping for bla TEM, bla CTX-M, and bla SHV genes by using conventional polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Escherichia coli was the most common (28.84%) Gram-negative bacillus followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (18.07%), while Pseudomonas spp. (9.61%) was the most commonly identified nonfermenter. ESBL production was detected in 160 (30.8%) isolates. Klebsiella oxytoca (46.7%) followed by E. coli (44%) were the common ESBL producers. Most predominant ESBL gene was bla TEM, found in 122 (76.25%) isolates. Combinations of two genes were seen in 109 (68.1%) isolates, the most common (43.12%) combination being blaTEM and blaCTX-M. In this study, 16 (10%) strains had all the three types of genes. Most of the isolated Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) were sensitive to amikacin, imipenem, and colistin. CONCLUSION: In our study, the 30.8% of GNB were ESBL producers. This is the only study that shows that TEM is the most prevalent ESBL genotypes in our area. Of concern is a good number of isolates showing all three patterns of genes (TEM, SHV, and CTX-M). Amikacin, imipenem, and colistin were the most useful antibiotics in our setup.

31586550|t|Involvement of PI3K/Akt/GSK-3beta signaling pathway in the antidepressant-like and neuroprotective effects of Morus nigra and its major phenolic, syringic acid.
31586550|a|Depression is a common neuropsychiatric disorder whose pathophysiology has been associated with glutamatergic excitotoxicity. Thus, the research for new antidepressant strategies with the ability to mitigate glutamate toxicity has received growing attention. Given this background, the present study sought to investigate the antidepressant-like and neuroprotective effects of Morus nigra (MN) and its major phenolic, syringic acid (SA), against glutamate-induced damage, as well as, the role of the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3beta signaling pathway in these effects. Treatment with MN (3 mg/kg) and SA (1 mg/kg) for 7 days, similar to fluoxetine (10 mg/kg), triggered an antidepressant-like effect. Moreover, the treatments evoked neuroprotection against glutamatergic excitotoxicity in hippocampal slices, and MN treatment also afforded protection in cerebrocortical slices. Notably, ex vivo neuroprotective effect of MN and SA was mediated, at least in part, by PI3K/Akt/GSK-3beta signaling pathway. Furthermore, the ability of MN and SA to counteract the glutamate-induced damage were evaluated in three different in vitro experiments. The hippocampal slices pretreated with MN (0.05 and 0.1 mug/mL) or SA (0.01-0.1 mug/mL) as well as the concomitant treatment with MN (0.01 and 0.05 mug/mL) or SA (0.05 and 0.1 mug/mL) exhibited protection against glutamate toxicity. Interestingly, post-treatment with MN in all doses (0.01-0.1 mug/mL) and SA at dose of 0.1 mug/mL were capable of preventing glutamate-induced cell death. In vitro neuroprotective effect of SA, but not MN, involves the activation of Akt, since the pretreatment with LY294002 completely abolished the protective effect. Overall, MN and SA presented antidepressant-like and neuroprotective effects against glutamatergic excitotoxicity via PI3K/Akt/GSK-3beta.

31587439|t|Adjuvant therapy with gamma-tocopherol-induce apoptosis in HT-29 colon cancer via cyclin-dependent cell cycle arrest mechanism.
31587439|a|Resistance to chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) is the major obstacle to reach the maximum efficiency of CRC treatment. Combination therapy has emerged as a novel anticancer strategy. The present study evaluates the cotreatment of gamma-tocopherol and 5-FU in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy against HT-29 colon cancer cells. Cytotoxic effect of this combination was examined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and a synergistic effect was evaluated by a combination index technique. Nuclear morphology was studied via 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining and flow cytometric assays were conducted to identify molecular mechanisms of apoptosis and cell cycle progression. We investigated the expression of Cyclin D1, Cyclin E, Bax, and Bcl-2 by a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The IC50 values for 5-FU and gamma-tocopherol were 21.8  +- 2.5 and 14.4 +- 2.6 muM, respectively, and also this combination therapeutic increased the percentage of apoptotic cells from 35% +- 2% to 40% +-  4% (P  <  .05). Furthermore, incubation HT-29 colon cells with combined concentrations of two drugs caused significant accumulation of cells in the subGsubG1 phase. Our results presented the combination therapy with 5-FU and gamma-tocopherol as a novel therapeutic approach, which can enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy.

31594861|t|A thiazole-derived oridonin analog exhibits antitumor activity by directly and allosterically inhibiting STAT3.
31594861|a|Constitutive activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) occurs in approximately 70% of human cancers, and STAT3 is regarded as one of the most promising targets for cancer therapy. However, specific direct STAT3 inhibitors remain to be developed. Oridonin is an ent-kaurane plant-derived diterpenoid with anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory activities. Here, using an array of cell-based and biochemical approaches, including cell proliferation and apoptosis assays, pull-down and reporter gene assays, site-directed mutagenesis, and molecular dynamics analyses, we report that a thiazole-derived oridonin analog, CYD0618, potently and directly inhibits STAT3. We found that CYD0618 covalently binds to Cys-542 in STAT3 and suppresses its activity through an allosteric effect, effectively reducing STAT3 dimerization and nuclear translocation, as well as decreasing expression of STAT3-targeted oncogenes. Remarkably, CYD0618 not only strongly inhibited growth of multiple cancer cell lines that harbor constitutive STAT3activation, but it also suppressed in vivo tumor growth, via STAT3 inhibition. Taken together, our findings suggest Cys-542 as a druggable site for selectively inhibiting STAT3 and indicate that CYD0618 represents a promising lead compound for developing therapeutic agents against STAT3-driven diseases.

31595789|t|In silico evaluation of pesticides as potential modulators of human DNA methyltransferases.
31595789|a|DNA methylations are carried out by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) that are key enzymes during gene expression. Many chemicals, including pesticides, have shown modulation of epigenetic functions by inhibiting DNMTs. In this work, human DNMTs were evaluated as a potential target for pesticides through virtual screening of 1038 pesticides on DNMT1 (3SWR) and DNMT3A (2QRV). Molecular docking calculations for DNMTs-pesticide complexes were performed using AutoDock Vina. Binding-affinity values and contact patterns were employed as selection criteria of pesticides as virtual hits for DNMTs. The best three DNMT-pesticides complexes selected according to their high absolute affinity values (kcal/mol), for both DNMT1 and DNMT3A, were flocoumafen (-12.5; -9.9), brodifacoum (-12.4; -8.4) and difenacoum (-12.1; -8.7). These chemicals belong to second-generation rodenticides. The most frequent predicted interacting residues for DNMT1-pesticide complexes were Trp1170A, Phe1145A, Asn1578A, Arg1574A and Pro1225A; whereas for DNMT3A those were Arg271B, Lys740A, and Glu303B. These results suggest that rodenticides used for pest control are potential DNMT ligands and therefore, may modulate DNA methylations. This finding has important environmental and clinical implications, as epigenetic pathways are critical in many biochemical processes leading to diseases.

31617652|t|Kinesin family member 18B: A contributor and facilitator in the proliferation and metastasis of cutaneous melanoma.
31617652|a|Melanoma is the most aggressive type of cutaneous tumor and the occurrence of metastasis makes it resistant to almost all available treatment and becomes incorrigible. Hence, identifying metastasis-related biomarkers and effective therapeutic targets will assist in preventing metastasis and ameliorating cutaneous melanoma. In our present study, we reported kinesin family member 18B (KIF18B) as a novel contributor in cutaneous melanoma proliferation and metastasis, and it was found to be of great significance in predicting the prognosis of cutaneous melanoma patients. Bioinformatics analysis based on ONCOMINE, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and Genotype-Tissue Expression database revealed that KIF18B was highly expressed in cutaneous melanoma and remarkably correlated with unfavorable clinical outcomes. Consistently, the results of the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction exhibited that the expression of KIF18B was significantly higher in cutaneous melanoma cell lines than that in normal cells. In vitro, biological assays found that knockdown of KIF18B in cutaneous melanoma cells noticeably repressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while inducing cell apoptosis. Moreover, the protein expression of E-cadherin was enhanced while the expression of N-cadherin, vimentin, and Snail was decreased in M14 cells after knocking down KIF18B. In addition, the phosphorylation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was significantly suppressed in M14 cells with silenced KIF18B. Above all, our results indicated that the repression of cutaneous melanoma cell migration and proliferation caused by KIF18B depletion suggested an oncogenic role of KIF18B in cutaneous melanoma, which acts through modulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition and ERK/PI3K pathway.

31629013|t|Telmisartan and captopril ameliorate pregabalin-induced heart failure in rats.
31629013|a|Pregabalin (PRG) is highly effective in the treatment of epilepsy, neuropathic pain and anxiety disorders. Despite its potential benefits, PRG administration has been reported to induce or exacerbate heart failure (HF). It has been previously documented that overactivation of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) is involved in HF pathophysiological mechanism. The target of the current study was to examine the possible cardioprotective effect of telmisartan (Tel), an angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) blocker, compared with that of captopril (Cap), an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, in ameliorating PRG-induced HF in rats by assessing morphometric, echocardiographic and histopathological parameters. Furthermore, to investigate the role of RAS blockade by the two drugs in guarding against PRG-induced changes in cardiac angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) and angiotensin II (Ang II) levels, in addition to myocardial expression of ACE2, ACE, Mas receptor (MasR) and AT1R. Results showed that PRG administration induced morphometric, echocardiographic and histopathological deleterious alterations and significantly elevated cardiac Ang II, ACE and AT1R levels, while reduced Ang 1-7, ACE2 and MasR cardiac levels. Concurrent treatment with either Tel or Cap reversed PRG-induced morphometric, echocardiographic and histopathological abnormalities and revealed prominent protection against PRG-induced HF via downregulation of ACE/Ang II/AT1R and upregulation of ACE2/Ang 1-7/MasR axes. These are the first findings to demonstrate that the potential benefits of Tel and Cap are mediated by counteracting the altered balance between the RAS axes induced by PRG. Hence; Tel and Cap may attenuate PRG-induced HF partially through stimulation of ACE2/Ang 1-7/MasR pathway.

31629898|t|High bisphenol A concentrations augment the invasiveness of tumor cells through Snail-1/Cx43/ERRgamma-dependent epithelial-mesenchymal transition.
31629898|a|Bisphenol A (BPA) is commonly present in plastics used for food storage and preservation. The release of BPA from these products results in a permanent human exposition to BPA; however, the quality and quantity of BPA adverse effects remain a matter of controversy. The common presence of BPA in the human environment and the controversies concerning the relations of human exposition to BPA and cancer incidence justify the research on the interactions between BPA and pro-metastatic signaling in cancer cells. Here, we describe a novel BPA-reactive signaling axis that induces the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells. BPA exerted negligible effects on their properties in a wide range of concentrations (10 nM - 100 nM), whereas it considerably induced A549 invasiveness at high concentrations (10 muM). The BPA-induced EMT was illustrated by morphologic changes, E/N-cadherin switch and vimentin/Snail-1/connexin(Cx)43 up-regulation in A549 populations. It was followed by enhancement of A549 drug-resistance. Corresponding effects of BPA were observed in prostate cancer cell populations. Concomitantly, we observed increased levels and perinuclear accumulation of estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERRgamma) in BPA-treated cells, its interactions with Cx43/Snail-1, and the corresponding effects of phenol red on A549 cells. Collectively, these data identify a novel, pro-metastatic Snail-1/Cx43/ERRgamma signaling pathway. Its reactivity to BPA underlies the induction of cancer cells' invasiveness in the presence of high BPA concentrations in vitro. Thus, the chronic exposition of cancer cells to extrinsic and intrinsic BPA should be considered as a potential obstacle in a cancer therapy.

31654708|t|Preventive effects of a natural anti-inflammatory agent Salvianolic acid A on acute kidney injury in mice.
31654708|a|Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an abrupt loss of kidney function with high mortality. Inflammatory is considered driving the progression of AKI. Salvianolic acid A (SA), one of the major ingredients of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, displays plenty of biological effects. Herein, the effect of SA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced AKI in mice and further related mechanism in inflammatory cells were explored. In vivo experiments demonstrated that SA significantly ameliorated LPS-challenged AKI by preventing glomerulus atrophy and decreasing plasma creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. Meanwhile, SA significantly decreased the release of serum inflammatory cytokines and blocked macrophage infiltration in damaged renal tissue. In in vitro studies, SA significantly decreased TNF-alpha and IL-6 release levels and altered the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in LPS-stimulated macrophages, which were consistent with the results from in vivo experiments. Furthermore, SA that bound to Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) was able to reduce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in response to LPS stimulation. All silence of TLR4 gene, ROS scavenger and Ca2+ chelator decreased inflammatory cytokines releases. Taken together, SA could be used as a potential therapeutic agent for preventing AKI by suppressing inflammatory responses.

31654802|t|The neglected foodborne mycotoxin Fusaric acid induces bioenergetic adaptations by switching energy metabolism from mitochondrial processes to glycolysis in a human liver (HepG2) cell line.
31654802|a|Metabolic flexibility defines the capacity of cells to respond to changes in nutrient status. Mitochondria are important mediators of metabolic flexibility and dysfunction is associated with metabolic inflexibility and pathology. Foodborne toxins are often overlooked as potential factors contributing to metabolic toxicity. Fusaric acid (FA), a neglected mycotoxin, is known to disrupt mitochondrial function. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying a metabolic switch in response to FA. This study investigated the effects of FA on energy homeostasis in cultured human liver (HepG2) cells. HepG2 cells poised to undergo oxidative and glycolytic metabolism were exposed to a range of FA concentrations (4, 63 and 250 microg/mL) for 6 hours. We determined mitochondrial toxicity, acetyl CoA levels and cell viability using luminometric, fluorometric and spectrophotometric methods. Expression of metabolic proteins (PDK1, PKM2, phosphorylated-PDH E1alpha and HIF-1alpha) and mRNAs (HIF-1alpha, PKM2, LDHa and PDK1) were determined using western blot and qPCR respectively. Our data connects a constitutive expression of HIF-1alpha in response to FA, to the inhibition of pyruvate decarboxylation through up-regulation of PDK-1 and phosphorylation of Pyruvate Dehydrogenase E1alpha subunit. Moreover, we highlight the potential of FA to induce a glucose "addiction" and phenotype reminiscent of the Warburg effect. The findings provide novel insights into the impact of this neglected foodborne mycotoxin in the dysregulation of energy metabolism.

31672515|t|The potential efficacy of dietary fatty acids and fructose induced inflammation and oxidative stress on the insulin signaling and fat accumulation in mice.
31672515|a|The aim of the present study was to clarify whether oxidative stress and inflammatory responses are related to impaired insulin signaling and fat accumulation induced by the dietary fatty acids and fructose. C57BL/6 type 8 week-old male mice (n = 10/per group) were fed with standard chow or three isocaloric diets consisting fructose, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), or saturated fatty acid (SFA) for 15 weeks. After the dietary manipulation, the mice were sacrificed, tissues and blood were collected. Consequently, body weight gains, liver weights, and plasma homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) values in were at higher levels in SFA and fructose groups (p < 0.05). The plasma concentrations of the non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), triglyceride (TG), and liver steatosis were found to be at higher levels in SFA and fructose groups (p < 0.05). Moreover, the expression levels of acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 (ACC1), insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) in the liver were affected by the intake of SFA and fructose. Furthermore, the plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1) and the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in the liver were elevated in SFA and fructose group (p < 0.05). The plasma level of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL -10) was found to be lower in the SFA group compared to the other groups (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the inflammation and oxidation are related with the fatty acid- and fructose-induced impaired insulin signaling and fat accumulation in liver. Hence, in order to decrease the oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory response, it is substantial to reduce the saturated fat and added sugar or to replace with the unsaturated fat and complex carbohydrates in diet.

7885191|t|Drosophila GABA-gated chloride channel: modified [3H]EBOB binding site associated with Ala--&gt;Ser or Gly mutants of Rdl subunit.
7885191|a|The non-competitive blocker site of the GABA-gated chloride ion channel in normal susceptible strains of Drosophila melanogaster and simulans binds 4-n-[3H]propyl-4'-ethynylbicycloorthobenzoate ([3H]EBOB) at specific sites with KdS of 1.6-1.9 nM and BmaxS of 171-181 fmol/mg protein. This specific binding of [3H]EBOB is strongly inhibited by: a large number and variety of insecticidal channel blockers at 20 nM (lindane, alpha-endosulfan, dieldrin, 12-ketoendrin, fipronil, and a representative bicycloorthobenzoate and dithiane) or 200 nM (picrotoxinin); the insecticidal channel activators avermectin and moxidectin at 20 nM; muscimol at 30 microM and GABA at 300 microM. Cyclodiene resistance in D. melanogaster has been attributed to a mutation resulting in an Ala302--&gt;Ser replacement in the Rdl GABA receptor subunit and in D. simulans to an homologous Ala--&gt;Ser or Gly replacement. These mutations are shown here to greatly reduce [3H]EBOB binding, i.e. lower affinity and apparent number of binding sites. The Ala--&gt;Ser replacement with both melanogaster and simulans almost always reduces the potency in inhibiting [3H]EBOB binding of each of eight channel blockers and of muscimol and GABA. The Ala--&gt;Gly replacement in D. simulans is generally less effective than the Ala--&gt;Ser modification in reducing sensitivity to the channel blockers and to muscimol and GABA. The channel activators avermectin and moxidectin usually retain their inhibitory potency in the Rdl subunit mutants. Thus, it appears that replacement of Ala by Ser generally modifies the non-competitive blocker site and its coupling to the GABA-recognition site with less effect on the channel activator site. In contrast, the Ala--&gt;Gly replacement has less impact in protecting the chloride channel from the action of insecticidal blockers. Each of the resistant strains has the same level of resistance to the lethal action of the five channel blockers examined but none to avermectins and muscimol.

7912539|t|Cardiac effects of the beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist BRL35135 in man.
7912539|a|The aim of the present study was to evaluate the cardiac effects of the beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist BRL35135, and determine whether beta 3-receptors are involved in mediating chronotropic or inotropic responses in man. Eight normal males received single oral doses of BRL35135 8 mg (BRL) or the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol 8 mg (SAL), after pretreatment with either placebo (PL), bisoprolol 5 mg (B5) as a selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, or nadolol 20 mg (N20) to block beta 1- and beta 2- but not beta 3-receptors. Both BRL and SAL produced a significant increase in postural finger tremor in keeping with beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation, and this response was totally abolished by pretreatment with N20. Significant increases in systolic blood pressure and Doppler stroke distance occurred with BRL and SAL which were unaffected by pretreatment with B5 and completely blocked by N20, in keeping with beta 2-mediated effects. BRL and SAL produced significant chronotropic and minute distance responses which were unaffected by beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade. However, whereas N20 blocked these responses to SAL, a small but significant response occurred with BRL in comparison with placebo despite complete blockade of co-existing beta 2-mediated effects. Compared with PL, the mean responses to N20/BRL, and the 95% confidence interval for the differences between the means were 7.4 beats min-1 [3.2 to 11.6] (P = 0.002) for heart rate, and 208.8 cm [38.3 to 379.3] (P = 0.02) for minute distance responses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

9557255|t|A new concept of drug delivery for acne.
9557255|a|Adapalene is a stable naphthoic acid derivative that displays a strong retinoid agonist pharmacology. This drug controls cell proliferation and differentiation, and possesses significant anti-inflammatory action. The retinoid action of adapalene are mediated by the ligand-activated gene transcription factors retinoic acid receptors RAR beta and RAR gamma. We describe here how an aqueous gel containing adapalene was selected for the topical treatment of acne.

9990413|t|Pharmacology of adapalene.
9990413|a|Adapalene, a synthetic retinoid, is a new drug proposed for the treatment of acne patients. Studies on the in vitro and in vivo pharmacology of adapalene have shown that it is very active on cell and tissue proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, adapalene has anti-inflammatory potential as determined by its anti-AP1 activity. Adapalene interacts selectively with the nuclear receptors RAR beta and RAR gamma, and its activity on proliferation and differentiation can be blocked by a RAR beta-gamma antagonist. Because RAR beta is not expressed in human keratinocytes, the effect of adapalene on the major cell type of the epidermis is certainly mediated by its interaction with RAR gamma. The unique pharmacological properties of adapalene may explain why, when compared to tretinoin, it has an improved therapeutic ratio due to its better tolerance.
